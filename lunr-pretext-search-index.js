  "body": " Fraction Arithmetic     Fraction   A fraction fraction is a number written in the form of one whole number over another, , where . The denominator , , tells us how many equally sized parts make up a whole. The numerator , , tells us how many of the parts are present.    Working with fractions can get tricky pretty quick. It is worth getting comfortable with a few real world examples that have nice fractions. This can be useful when you come across complicated and more abstract uses of fractions in the future, you can think back to something that's clear in your brain and even test out ideas with those friendly fractions, their visuals, and the situations they represent.  Pizza is helpful in many situations. Suppose a large pizza is cut into 12 equally sized pieces and that your family finished 8 of them during dinner. Since the pieces are all the same size and 12 of them make up an whole pizza, the denominator we want is 12. The number of pieces of pizza left, 4, is the numerator.   Your family ate 8 slices (unshaded) from a twelve-slice pizza, leaving 4 (shaded).      The fraction of the whole pizza left is written as and read as four twelveths . Just in case you are not a fan of pizza, there are many ways to think about and diagram this fraction:   A variety of diagrams of the fraction (shaded) and (unshaded).      We can think of the rectangle as representing desk in a classroom; the shaded desks have students sitting in them. Four twlefths of the desks have students. Perhaps the circles each represent a space in an egg carton. You've used eight twelfths of your dozen eggs. Suppose that the line segment represents a length of one foot. Since a foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shaded region is 4 inches or four twelfths of a foot. The stars could show the positions of players in a certain area of a field of play. Four twelfths of the players in this area are on the blue team and eight twelfths are on the white team.   Each whole is split into 12 equally sized parts and 4 of those parts are shaded.   Visualizing Fractions     Fill in blanks with fractions. Don t forget to reduce fractions if you can.  of the figure is shaded.  of the figure is not shaded.             The pie is cut into pieces evenly, so the denominator of the fractions is .  Since pieces are shaded, we can say of the figure is shaded. Notice that we must reduce fraction if we can.  Since pieces are not shaded, we can say of the figure is not shaded.       The fractions described above are considered proper fractions fraction proper ; the numerator is less than the denominator, . Fractions where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denomintor are called improper fractions fraction improper . Remember that fractions themselves, even though they have multiple pieces, represent a single value. A proper fraction has a value less than 1 while an improper fraction is greater than or equal to 1.   It is worth noting that outside of your math class, most people will use the word fraction in English to mean a proper fraction, and typically a proper fraction with a small value. For example, Only a fraction of the menu options are gluten free.    Since an improper fraction represents a value larger than 1, it can also be written as what is called a mixed number , a whole number and a fraction. Mixed numbers represent wholes and parts, so is 1 whole and 3 of 4 equally sized parts that make a whole. We can represent any fraction, proper or improper, in multiple ways.   Equivalent Fractions   Fractions that appear different but have the same value are called equivalent fractions fraction equivalent .    Before we get into the mechanics of equivalent fractions, let's think more about the pizza example. Even though what we'll actually be quite procedural in all our manipulations, it is important to remember what the fraction actually reprepsents.   Picturing Equivalent Fractions   Use the idea of the pizza to show that the fractions and are equivalent.    The pizza we considered earlier was cut into 12 equally sized pieces and 8 of those were eaten. If, rather than thinking about individual pieces as the equally sized parts that tell us what the denominator is, let's say that a serving of pizza is two slices. That means this pizza has 6 equally sized servings, the denominator, and if your family ate eight pieces they consumed 4 servings in total, the numerator. So, ( four sixths ) of the pizza has been eaten. We can see this visually in      We can view this as 4 out of 12 slices being shaded or as 2 out of 6 servings.      In both pizza diagrams, the same amount of pizza is shaded and the same amount remains unshaded. This is a visual to see that the fractions and are equivalent .   Try this same argument with the other diagrams in .   Most fraction computations are made simpler by using the equivalent improper fraction to a given mixed number. So, how we do convert a mixed number to an improper fraction? And, why are those equivalent? Of course, we'll start by thinking about pizza!  Suppose instead of the single large pizza from before, you order three medium pizzas each with 8 equally sized slices. This time, while you're gathering beverages, your dog takes 5 slices from one of the pizzas.   Three 8-slice pizzas with 5 slices taken.      We determine the improper fraction represented by the diagram in in the same way. Because 8 equally sized pieces make one whole pizza, this is the denominator of the fraction. The total number of slices is 19; we can see this by counting up to 19 or adding the 8 slices from each whole pizza to the three remaining slices in the partially eaten pizza. So, after the dog sneaks 5 slices, we have , nineteen eigths , of a pizza remaining. As a mixed number, this is 2 whole pizzas and 3 slices, .  Drawing diagrams to represent fractions is very useful, but not very practical for handling every fraction you come across. The procedures for converting between a mixed number, like the above, and an improper fraction are given below.   Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction     To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,  Multiply the whole number by the denominator,  Add this product to the numerator,  This sum is the new numerator of the improper fraction, and  The denominator of the improper fraction is the same as that of the fracitonal component of the mixed number.     Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction   Rewrite the mixed number as an equivalent improper fraction.         Multiply the whole number by the denominator, ,  Add this product to the numerator, ,  This sum is the new numerator of the improper fraction, and he denominator of the improper fraction is the same as that of the fracitonal component of the mixed number, .    Converting Mixed Numbers   Convert each mixed fraction to an improper fraction.  =  =  =   Multiply the whole number term by the denominator of the proper fraction. Combine with the other numerator.                       Convert an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number     To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number,  Divide the numerator by the denomintor, determine how many whole times the denominator goes in to the numerator,  Multiply this whole number quotient by the denominator,  Subtract this product from the numerator.  The quotient is the whole number, the difference is the numerator of the fractional piece, and the denominator remains the same.     Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction   Rewrite the improper fraction as an equivalent mixed number.         Divide the numerator by the denomintor, determine how many whole times the denominator goes in to the numerator, ,  Multiply this whole number quotient by the denominator, ,  Subtract this product from the numerator, .  The quotient is the whole number, the difference is the numerator of the fractional piece, and the denominator remains the same, .    Converting Improper Fractions   Change to mixed numbers.  Here is an example of how to put your answer in an answer box.  If your answer is then put 2 3\/5 into the answer  Make sure that you leave a space between the whole number and the fraction.  1) =  2) =  3) =                  Solution  1) When we divide 5 by 4 we get quotient 1 and remainder 1, so our answer is (1 1\/4).  2) When we divide 14 by 5 we get quotient 2 and remainder 4, so our answer is (2 4\/5).  3) When we divide 39 by 9 we get quotient 4 and remainder 3. But, since is not reduced,  we have to reduce it to and our answer is (4 1\/3).       We can replace any fraction or mixed number with an equivalent fraction at any step of any computation. We know the definition of quivalent fractions and can identify them in diagrams, but how to we change them numerically?   Equivalent Fractions     Any fraction, proper or improper or as a fractional piece of a mixed number, can be adjusted to an equivlent fraction by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same  non-zero number.  This tells us the allowable moves we can do to a fraction without changing its value.    We often hear the term reduced to refer to a particular form of a fraction. Usually, when someone says the fraction is reduced or in reduced form they mean that there is no other equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator or denominator. Often the reduced form a fraction is preferred, but that is not universally true.    Reduce the fraction as much as possible.    Since we want to make both the numerator and denominator smaller number, and keep the fraction equivalent, we look for numbers that we can divide both the numerator and denominator by.         There are many different strategies for this process; they all differ slightly but rely on . What we're looking for when trying to reduce a fraction are common factors of both the numerator and denominator. A common factor of a set of numbers is one that goes into every number of the set evenly with no remainders.  In this example, the numerator and denominator have several common factors. The order you notice them in will vary across people. You might notice first that 5 is a common factor. So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 5:   Next, you might notice that 3 is a common factor of both 18 and 21. So, we divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 3.   All of the equal signs above are used purposely; they tell us that the value of the fraction has not changed. This is true because we used one of the moves allowed by .  There is nothing special about the order here. If we noticed that both 105 and 90 are divisible by 3 first, we could have used that first, followed by 5, and we'd end up in the same place. It is also possible that one would notice that 15 is a common factor of both 90 and 105; and so we could complete the process in a single step by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15. It is typically easier to notice smaller common factors and easier to divide by those smaller numbers, but using smaller pieces requires more steps. With practice, you'll find a sweet spot that is good for your brain.  This can be tedious to write out this way when there are a lot of common factors. As long as you're careful with the use of equal signs and remember the allowable moves, some people prefer a sort of cancellation notation that might look like:   We know we cannot reduce this fraction further since 6 and 7 have no common factors; and .    Reducing Fractions   Put in simplest form.  For example if were the answer you would put 3\/7 in the answer box.  1) =  2) =  2) =                  Solution  1) To put into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator by 2  (which is their greatest common factor) to get answer which we put in the answer box as .  2) To put into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator  by 4 to get answer which we put in the answer box as .       For some computations, we need an equivalent fraction that is not reduced. We can use the other allowable move from for this. The most common place where we'd need this is for addition or subtraction of fractions.  When fractions have the same denominator, we simply add or subtract their numerators. Remember, the denominator tells us how many equally sized parts make up a whole, and we should think of these equally sized parts as the objects. So, in our first pizza example with 12 slices, the computation could represent one person eatin 5 slices and another eating 3 slices meaning altogether they ate 8 slices. We can simply add the number of slices up for a total, because the objects we're counting up are the same.  If the denominators are not the same, maybe slices from a large pizza and slices from a medium pizza, , then a total of 8 objects doesn't tell us what we want to know. It would be equivalent to asking something like If Jack has 5 bananas and Jill has 3 apples, what do they have alltogether? They have 8 pieces of fruit altogether, but they have neither 8 apples nor 8 bananas nor 8 banapples !  In order to make sure we're counting objects that are the same, we make sure the denominators of the fractions are equal before doing any addition or subtraction. We can use both moves in on any of the fractions to make this happen.    Complete the fraction addition coming from the example of pizzas with differing numbers of slices:     In order to be able to simply add the numerators, the denominators of the fractions must be the same. Try applying the moves from to one or both fractions. Can you do this so that you end up with equivalent fractions with the same denomintors?    Since both fractions and cannot be further reduced, we need to make the denominators match by making each of those numbers larger.  There are a few typical options for a common denominator , but as long as you've only used and have denomintors that are equal, any option is fine.  A common common denomintor ( words are hard ) is simply the product of the denominotrs we start with. When we multiply the 12 in the denominator by 8, we must also do the same to the numerator to keep the fraction equivalent. Similarly, multiplying the 8 denominator by 12 will make the denominators match, but we need to again do the same to the numerator to keep the fractions equivalent. In written out steps, this would look like     "

  "body": "  Complete the fraction addition coming from the example of pizzas with differing numbers of slices:     In order to be able to simply add the numerators, the denominators of the fractions must be the same. Try applying the moves from to one or both fractions. Can you do this so that you end up with equivalent fractions with the same denomintors?    Since both fractions and cannot be further reduced, we need to make the denominators match by making each of those numbers larger.  There are a few typical options for a common denominator , but as long as you've only used and have denomintors that are equal, any option is fine.  A common common denomintor ( words are hard ) is simply the product of the denominotrs we start with. When we multiply the 12 in the denominator by 8, we must also do the same to the numerator to keep the fraction equivalent. Similarly, multiplying the 8 denominator by 12 will make the denominators match, but we need to again do the same to the numerator to keep the fractions equivalent. In written out steps, this would look like    "
