  "body": " Fraction Arithmetic     Fraction   A fraction fraction is a number written in the form of one whole number over another, , where . The denominator , , tells us how many equally sized parts make up a whole. The numerator , , tells us how many of the parts are present.    Working with fractions can get tricky pretty quick. It is worth getting comfortable with a few real world examples that have nice fractions. This can be useful when you come across complicated and more abstract uses of fractions in the future, you can think back to something that's clear in your brain and even test out ideas with those friendly fractions, their visuals, and the situations they represent.  Pizza is helpful in many situations. Suppose a large pizza is cut into 12 equally sized pieces and that your family finished 8 of them during dinner. Since the pieces are all the same size and 12 of them make up a whole pizza, the denominator we want is 12. The number of pieces of pizza left, 4, is the numerator.   Your family ate 8 slices (unshaded) from a twelve-slice pizza, leaving 4 (shaded).      The fraction of the whole pizza left is written as and read as four twelveths . Just in case you are not a fan of pizza, there are many ways to think about and diagram this fraction:   A variety of diagrams of the fraction (shaded) and (unshaded).      We can think of the rectangle as representing desks in a classroom; the shaded desks have students sitting in them. Four twlefths of the desks have students. Perhaps the circles each represent a space in an egg carton. You've used eight twelfths of your dozen eggs. Suppose that the line segment represents a length of one foot. Since a foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shaded region is 4 inches or four twelfths of a foot. The stars could show the positions of players in a certain area of a field of play. Four twelfths of the players in this area are on the blue team and eight twelfths are on the white team.   Each whole is split into 12 equally sized parts and 4 of those parts are shaded.   Visualizing Fractions     Fill in blanks with fractions. Don t forget to reduce fractions if you can.  of the figure is shaded.  of the figure is not shaded.             The pie is cut into pieces evenly, so the denominator of the fractions is .  Since pieces are shaded, we can say of the figure is shaded. Notice that we must reduce fraction if we can.  Since pieces are not shaded, we can say of the figure is not shaded.       The fractions described above are considered proper fractions fraction proper ; the numerator is less than the denominator, . Fractions where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denomintor are called improper fractions fraction improper . Remember that fractions themselves, even though they have multiple pieces, represent a single value. A proper fraction has a value less than 1 while an improper fraction is greater than or equal to 1.   It is worth noting that outside of your math class, most people will use the word fraction in English to mean a proper fraction, and typically a proper fraction with a small value. For example, Only a fraction of the menu options are gluten free.    Since an improper fraction represents a value larger than 1, it can also be written as what is called a mixed number , a whole number and a fraction. Mixed numbers represent wholes and parts, so is 1 whole and 3 of 4 equally sized parts that make a whole. We can represent any fraction, proper or improper, in multiple ways.   Equivalent Fractions   Fractions that appear different but have the same value are called equivalent fractions fraction equivalent .    Before we get into the mechanics of equivalent fractions, let's think more about the pizza example. Even though we'll actually be quite procedural in all our manipulations, it is important to remember what the fraction actually reprepsents.   Picturing Equivalent Fractions   Use the idea of the pizza to show that the fractions and are equivalent.    The pizza we considered earlier was cut into 12 equally sized pieces and 8 of those were eaten. If, rather than thinking about individual pieces as the equally sized parts that tell us what the denominator is, let's say that a serving of pizza is two slices. That means this pizza has 6 equally sized servings, the denominator, and if your family ate eight pieces they consumed 4 servings in total, the numerator. So, ( four sixths ) of the pizza has been eaten. We can see this visually in   Similarly, we could consider a serving to be 4 slices so the whole pizza serves 3. The 8 slices eat are 2 servings, or of the pizza, and the 4 slices remaining are 1 serving, of the pizza.     We can view this as 4 out of 12 slices being shaded or as 2 out of 6 servings.      In both pizza diagrams, the same amount of pizza is shaded and the same amount remains unshaded. This is a visual to see that the fractions and are equivalent .   Try this same argument with the other diagrams in .   Most fraction computations are made simpler by using the equivalent improper fraction to a given mixed number. So, how we do convert a mixed number to an improper fraction? And, why are those equivalent? Of course, we'll start by thinking about pizza!  Suppose instead of the single large pizza from before, you order three medium pizzas each with 8 equally sized slices. This time, while you're gathering beverages, your dog takes 5 slices from one of the pizzas.   Three 8-slice pizzas with 5 slices taken.      We determine the improper fraction represented by the diagram in in the same way. Because 8 equally sized pieces make one whole pizza, this is the denominator of the fraction. The total number of slices is 19; we can see this by counting up to 19 or adding the 8 slices from each whole pizza to the three remaining slices in the partially eaten pizza. So, after the dog sneaks 5 slices, we have , nineteen eigths , of a pizza remaining. As a mixed number, this is 2 whole pizzas and 3 slices, .  Drawing diagrams to represent fractions is very useful, but not very practical for handling every fraction you come across. The procedures for converting between a mixed number, like the above, and an improper fraction are given below.   Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction     To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,  Multiply the whole number by the denominator,  Add this product to the numerator,  This sum is the new numerator of the improper fraction, and  The denominator of the improper fraction is the same as that of the fracitonal component of the mixed number.     Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction   Rewrite the mixed number as an equivalent improper fraction.         Multiply the whole number by the denominator, ,  Add this product to the numerator, ,  This sum is the new numerator of the improper fraction, and he denominator of the improper fraction is the same as that of the fracitonal component of the mixed number, .    Converting Mixed Numbers   Convert each mixed fraction to an improper fraction.  =  =  =   Multiply the whole number term by the denominator of the proper fraction. Combine with the other numerator.                       Convert an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number     To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number,  Divide the numerator by the denomintor, determine how many whole times the denominator goes in to the numerator,  Multiply this whole number quotient by the denominator,  Subtract this product from the numerator.  The quotient is the whole number, the difference is the numerator of the fractional piece, and the denominator remains the same.     Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction   Rewrite the improper fraction as an equivalent mixed number.         Divide the numerator by the denomintor, determine how many whole times the denominator goes in to the numerator, ,  Multiply this whole number quotient by the denominator, ,  Subtract this product from the numerator, .  The quotient is the whole number, the difference is the numerator of the fractional piece, and the denominator remains the same, .    Converting Improper Fractions   Change to mixed numbers.  Here is an example of how to put your answer in an answer box.  If your answer is then put 2 3\/5 into the answer  Make sure that you leave a space between the whole number and the fraction.  1) =  2) =  3) =                  Solution  1) When we divide 5 by 4 we get quotient 1 and remainder 1, so our answer is (1 1\/4).  2) When we divide 14 by 5 we get quotient 2 and remainder 4, so our answer is (2 4\/5).  3) When we divide 39 by 9 we get quotient 4 and remainder 3. But, since is not reduced,  we have to reduce it to and our answer is (4 1\/3).       We can replace any fraction or mixed number with an equivalent fraction at any step of any computation. We know the definition of equivalent fractions and can identify them in diagrams, but how to we change them numerically?   Equivalent Fractions     Any fraction, proper or improper or as a fractional piece of a mixed number, can be adjusted to an equivlent fraction by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same  non-zero number.  This tells us the allowable moves we can do to a fraction without changing its value.    We often hear the term reduced to refer to a particular form of a fraction. Usually, when someone says the fraction is reduced or in reduced form they mean that there is no other equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator or denominator. Often the reduced form of a fraction is preferred, but that is not universally true.   Reduce a Fraction   Reduce the fraction as much as possible.    Since we want to make both the numerator and denominator smaller number, and keep the fraction equivalent, we look for numbers that we can divide both the numerator and denominator by.         There are many different strategies for this process; they all differ slightly but rely on . What we're looking for when trying to reduce a fraction are common factors of both the numerator and denominator. A common factor of a set of numbers is one that goes into every number of the set evenly with no remainders.  In this example, the numerator and denominator have several common factors. The order you notice them in will vary across people. You might notice first that 5 is a common factor. (Numbers that are divisible by five end with a 0 or a 5.) So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 5: .  Next, you might notice that 3 is a common factor of both 18 and 21. (If a number is divisible by three, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. For these numbers, and .) So, we divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 3: .  All of the equal signs above are used purposely; they tell us that the value of the fraction has not changed. This is true because we used one of the moves allowed by .  There is nothing special about the order here. If we noticed that both 105 and 90 are divisible by 3 first, we could have used that first, followed by 5, and we'd end up in the same place. It is also possible that one would notice that 15 is a common factor of both 90 and 105; and so we could complete the process in a single step by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15. It is typically easier to notice smaller common factors and easier to divide by those smaller numbers, but using smaller pieces requires more steps. With practice, you'll find a sweet spot that is good for your brain.  This can be tedious to write out this way when there are a lot of common factors. As long as you're careful with the use of equal signs and remember the allowable moves, some people prefer a sort of cancellation notation that might look like: .  We know we cannot reduce this fraction further since 6 and 7 have no common factors; and .  Writing and above is called the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. This simply means that we have found all the factors and nothing can be broken down into smaller pieces. Lots of folks like to use a sort of tree diagram to find this factorization. That tiny 2 that is up a little higher is an exponent. If you need a refresher, check out .    Reducing Fractions   Put in simplest form.  For example if were the answer you would put 3\/7 in the answer box.  1) =  2) =  2) =                  Solution  1) To put into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator by 2  (which is their greatest common factor) to get answer which we put in the answer box as .  2) To put into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator  by 4 to get answer which we put in the answer box as .       For some computations, we need an equivalent fraction that is not reduced. We can use the other allowable move from for this. The most common place where we'd need this is for addition or subtraction of fractions.  When fractions have the same denominator, we simply add or subtract their numerators. Remember, the denominator tells us how many equally sized parts make up a whole, and we should think of these equally sized parts as the objects. So, in our first pizza example with 12 slices, the computation could represent one person eating 5 slices and another eating 3 slices meaning altogether they ate 8 slices. We can simply add the number of slices up for a total, because the objects we're counting up are the same.  If the denominators are not the same, maybe from large pizzas cut into a different number of slices, , then a total of 8 objects doesn't tell us what we want to know. It would be equivalent to asking something like If Jack has 5 bananas and Jill has 3 apples, what do they have altogether? They have 8 pieces of fruit altogether, but they have neither 8 apples nor 8 bananas nor 8 banapples !  In order to make sure we're counting objects that are the same, we make sure the denominators of the fractions are equal before doing any addition or subtraction. We can use both moves in on any of the fractions to make this happen.   Add Fractions   Complete the fraction addition coming from the example of pizzas with differing numbers of slices:     In order to be able to simply add the numerators, the denominators of the fractions must be the same. Try applying the moves from to one or both fractions. Can you do this so that you end up with equivalent fractions with the same denomintors?    Since both fractions and cannot be further reduced, we need to make the denominators match by making each of those numbers larger.  There are a few typical options for a common denominator , but as long as you've only used and have denomintors that are equal, any option is fine.  A common common denomintor ( words are hard ) is simply the product of the denominators we start with. When we multiply the 12 in the denominator by 8, we must also do the same to the numerator to keep the fraction equivalent. Similarly, multiplying the 8 denominator by 12 will make the denominators match, but we need to again do the same to the numerator to keep the fractions equivalent. In written out steps, this would look like .  Notice that this final answer is not a reduced fraction. This might not be a problem at all!   Since the denominator is very close to 100, we may be able to get better sense of how large this fraction actually is in this form: .    You might also just want to do the division in a calculator to convert this to a decimal number anyway, and in that case, the size of the numerator and denominator matter less. .    These fractions also might represent a situtation where 96 equally sized make one whole. In that case, the form of this answer tells us that we have exactly 76 of those objects.     If you do want to reduce this fraction, it works in the same way as : .  Another choice for a common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators. This approach has the benefit of keeping the denominator as small as possible, but the steps to find the least common multiple may be numerous.  For this example, the least common multiple of 12 and 8 is 24. With this common denominator, the steps look like: . This method will more often, but not always , end in an answer that is already reduced. We can see from the reduced forms, that both methods produce equivalent fractions as the final answer.    Both and present multiple methods and approaches for acheiving the same goal; the answers (while they might look different) are the same with all methods.   Carefully read different approaches so that you can apply those methods if needed. But the best method is always the one that YOUR BRAIN is the most comfortable with and makes the most sense to YOU .   Adding Fractions   Add the fractions, and reduce your answer. The reduced answer is            Conceptually, multiplication and division of fractions is trickier, but procedurally, it is easier (for most folks) than addition or subtraction. So, we'll start with the process for each operation.   Multiplying Fractions     If needed, convert all factors from mixed numbers to improper fractions, .  Multiply the numerators of all the factors to determine the numerator of the product.  Multiply the denominators of all the factors to determine the denominator of the product.  If desired, reduce the product, , or convert from an improper fraction to a mixed number, .     Multiply Fractions   Multiply .    We first convert the one mixed number factor, , into an improper fraction: .  Now, we multiply across, numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators: .  We can convert this product to a reduce mixed number: , or .    Multiplying Fractions   Simplify the following and express your answer as a single fraction. No decimals or mixed fractions.    Remember, to enter a fraction of the form , type a \/ b.   Numerators \/ Denominators            We will divert from our pizza example to help visualize and conceptualize multiplication. Pizza is still great, but things that make us think in rectangles will be better for this concept. Let's first imagine a classroom with 5 rows of 6 desks. How many desks are there total? You might do the computation and correctly give the answer of 30 desks without much thought. Thinking about rectangles and area can help us see why this answer of 30 makes sense, but also why 5 times 6 is the same as 6 times 5, and the visualization with help with fractions in just a bit.   30 desks arranged in 5 rows with 6 desks in each row.      This picture helps us visualize the five groups of six objects that the mathematical expression represents. We can also turn the picture or our heads sideways and see that the number of desks don't change. So, five groups of six objects is the same as six groups of five objects ; not an obvious truth when it is just the words.  The spaces between the squares are to help us see them as desks. We could draw a very similar picture without space to thing about the area of a rug that is 5 feet by 6 feet. Now, for a similar picture to that, but thinking in fractions this time.   An area diagram to show that .      Remember that the product of two numbers (what we get after multiplying) is the area of a rectangle with those two numbers as its length and width. The area of the entire largest square in is . (We should note that the units of the product here would be square units, like square feet if the sides were measured in feet. In the real world, this is an important distinction, but we're safe to ignore the units for this discussion of the numbers.) The area of the purple\/crosshatched rectangle we can compute via multiplication, length times width. The length measured vertically in blue is . We can tell this because that side of the square is split into 5 equally sized pieces (the denominator) and the length is 3 of those pieces (the numerator). Similary, the width measured horizontally in red is . To compute the area, we multiply these two values: . This product can be reduced, but this is a good example of when doing that reduction is not helpful. This is what the procedure for multiplication, , tells us to do, but why does this answer and process make sense?  First, the answer. We see the fraction and know this means there are 30 equally sized pices to make a whole and we are considering 15 of those pieces. We consider the largest square to be the whole, and we can count the 30 smaller rectangles that make up the whole and the 15 that are shaded purple\/crosshatched. Hooray! That answer aligns with our picture, but doesn't explain why this is always the procedure.  In order to determine how many equally sized smaller rectangles make the whole large square, we can think about it in the same way as the desks: 5 rows of 6 desks each. Notice that 5 is the denominator of the first fraction, since that side of the square is split into 5 equal segments, and 6 is the denominator of the second fraction. To determine the numerator, we need to think about the area of the purple\/crosshatched region. This is 15 rectangles as we said before, in 3 rows (the numerator fo the first fraction) of 5 rectangles (the numerator of the second fraction).   Try to draw a similar diagram for , , or a fraction multiplication problem that you make up.   Lastly, we need to know how to divide fractions. The most important thing to remember here, is that multiplication and division are inverse processes. Also, a fraction's reciprocal , exchanging the positions of the numerator and denominator, is what is called its multiplicative inverse .  So that we can all use the same language, in a division problem, like , the first number (fraction or not), , is the dividend , the second number, , is the divisor , and the answer, is the quotient . Is is also worth remembering that a fraction itself represents division, . The horizontal line in a fraction, called a vinculum tells us to to complete any operations on the top and bottom separately first, and then divide the numerator by tthe denomintor.   Dividing Fractions     If needed, convert the dividend and divisor from mixed numbers to improper fractions, .  Replace the divisor with its reciprocal and the division sign with multiplication.  Multiply the fractions.  If desired, reduce the product, , or convert from an improper fraction to a mixed number,      Divide Fractions   Divide .    We first convert the mixed number divisor, , into an improper fraction: .  Now, we flip the divisor and change the division to multiplication: .  Lastly, we mutiply across , just like :   We can reduce in the process of multiplying by canceling common factors: .    Dividing Fractions   Divide one fraction into the other:  If needed, use an improper fraction in your answer. Don’t use a mixed number.        When we do division with fractions, as with   we first change division to multiplication, and at the same time, flip the second fraction. In this case, we have   Then we do fraction multiplication as usual. The full process is:        Rather than using diagram to make sense of why fraction division works this way, we are going to try another good mathly brain habit:   Check the correctness of a procedure using nice, easy, known examples.   In this case, that means we want to use facts that we know about division and check if a procedure gives us the correct result. First, we should know that any non-zero number divided by itself is equal to 1. As long as I don't choose 0, I can be as whacky as I want to be with these numbers: This should give you the feeling that flipping and multiplying is at least on the right track But, how do we know which fraction to flip? You can try whole numbers that you're comfortable with: Remember that a fraction is also division, so we can write whole numbers as fractions by giving them a denominator of 1. If we had erroneously flipped the first fraction above, we would end up with an incorrect answer of .  Another option is to relate this back to words. Words can be both tricky, helpful, or both, so this approach is not going to work well for every brain. Again, sticking with nice easy number is a good plan. One can read as the question, If I split  into 2 equally sized pieces, how large are those pieces? Hopefully, we're comfortable enough thinking about what fractions are that we can see that this answer is , and that agrees with the answer we'd get following the procedure. Possibly less familiar is using the word of when we use multiplication. This makes sense with whole numbers; Five groups of six apples is apples. And, it makes sense with fractions too. \"One half of 30 apples is 15.\" Figuring out one half of something is the same as dividing that something by two. So, .  When we divide fractions with the same denominator, we're comparing the same objects, so it works similarly to addition or subtraction once we've found a common denominator. Consider . We can think of fourteenths as the objects. Since they are the same, they could be anything! Nine widgets divided by three widgets is the same as the fraction question, and we can think about dividing 9 widgets up into groups of 3 widgets each We get 3 groups! This can help us check if we should flip the first or second fraction.  For anything involving fractions, it is worth figuring out a scenario that you're comfortable with to test out ideas in. Some people who cook or bake frequently, work really well with halves and thirds and quarters, and are comfortable halving or tripling a recipe; that's division and multiplication of fractions. If you have experience in construction or carpentry, you're likely to be comfortable with halves, quarters, eigths, sixteenths, and even thirtyseconds. You are probably very comfortable knowing which drill bit is larger. Fabric for sewing is sold by the yard, and you often need to add up the different pieces to know how much total yardage you need. You can always round up to be safe, but you can also buy in quarters of a yard and not spend as much.  Fractions don't have to be scary, and the above examples are all instances where time and practice has led to being more comfortable and confident.  "

That means this pizza has 6 equally sized servings, the denominator, and if your family ate eight pieces they consumed 4 servings in total, the numerator. So, ( four sixths ) of the pizza has been eaten. We can see this visually in   Similarly, we could consider a serving to be 4 slices so the whole pizza serves 3. The 8 slices eat are 2 servings, or of the pizza, and the 4 slices remaining are 1 serving, of the pizza.   "

Since we want to make both the numerator and denominator smaller number, and keep the fraction equivalent, we look for numbers that we can divide both the numerator and denominator by.         There are many different strategies for this process; they all differ slightly but rely on . What we're looking for when trying to reduce a fraction are common factors of both the numerator and denominator. A common factor of a set of numbers is one that goes into every number of the set evenly with no remainders.  In this example, the numerator and denominator have several common factors. The order you notice them in will vary across people. You might notice first that 5 is a common factor. (Numbers that are divisible by five end with a 0 or a 5.) So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 5: .  Next, you might notice that 3 is a common factor of both 18 and 21. (If a number is divisible by three, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. For these numbers, and .) So, we divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 3: .  All of the equal signs above are used purposely; they tell us that the value of the fraction has not changed. This is true because we used one of the moves allowed by .  There is nothing special about the order here. If we noticed that both 105 and 90 are divisible by 3 first, we could have used that first, followed by 5, and we'd end up in the same place. It is also possible that one would notice that 15 is a common factor of both 90 and 105; and so we could complete the process in a single step by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15. It is typically easier to notice smaller common factors and easier to divide by those smaller numbers, but using smaller pieces requires more steps. With practice, you'll find a sweet spot that is good for your brain.  This can be tedious to write out this way when there are a lot of common factors. As long as you're careful with the use of equal signs and remember the allowable moves, some people prefer a sort of cancellation notation that might look like: .  We know we cannot reduce this fraction further since 6 and 7 have no common factors; and .  Writing and above is called the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. This simply means that we have found all the factors and nothing can be broken down into smaller pieces. Lots of folks like to use a sort of tree diagram to find this factorization.

Try applying the moves from to one or both fractions. Can you do this so that you end up with equivalent fractions with the same denomintors?    Since both fractions and cannot be further reduced, we need to make the denominators match by making each of those numbers larger.  There are a few typical options for a common denominator , but as long as you've only used and have denomintors that are equal, any option is fine.  A common common denomintor ( words are hard ) is simply the product of the denominators we start with. When we multiply the 12 in the denominator by 8, we must also do the same to the numerator to keep the fraction equivalent. Similarly, multiplying the 8 denominator by 12 will make the denominators match, but we need to again do the same to the numerator to keep the fractions equivalent. In written out steps, this would look like .  Notice that this final answer is not a reduced fraction. This might not be a problem at all!   Since the denominator is very close to 100, we may be able to get better sense of how large this fraction actually is in this form: .    You might also just want to do the division in a calculator to convert this to a decimal number anyway, and in that case, the size of the numerator and denominator matter less. .    These fractions also might represent a situtation where 96 equally sized make one whole. In that case, the form of this answer tells us that we have exactly 76 of those objects.     If you do want to reduce this fraction, it works in the same way as : .  Another choice for a common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators. This approach has the benefit of keeping the denominator as small as possible, but the steps to find the least common multiple may be numerous.  For this example, the least common multiple of 12 and 8 is 24. With this common denominator, the steps look like: . This method will more often, but not always , end in an answer that is already reduced. We can see from the reduced forms, that both methods produce equivalent fractions as the final answer.   "

Consider the number 123.456. Each or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the digits of the number. The location (place) of the digit tells us what it represents (its value). The digit immediately to the left of the decimal point is the ones place so the digit and the numerical value are the same. Moving to the left increases the value of a digit by a factor of 10. So, the 2 above represents 2 tens, or 20, and the 1 represents 1 hundred, 100. Digits to the right of the decimal point represent values less than one. The first digit is in the tenths place, and tells us how many s we have. Therefore, the 4 in 123.456 represents 4 tenths, or . Moving to the right decreases the value by a factor of 10, which increases the denominator of the fraction by a factor of 10.

How can we make sense of these numbers?   Percent    Percent literally means per 100, or parts per hundred. When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction or the decimal 0.40. Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since . See .    To work with information given as percentages, it is critical to be able to write it in decimal or fraction form.    243 people out of 400 state that they like dogs. What percent is this?     . This is 60.75%.  Notice that the percent can be found from the equivalent decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the right.      Write each as a percent:                                          Decimals as Percents   Convert the following decimals into percentages:                        To change a decimal to a percentage, we move the decimal point to the right twice.           Percentages     If we have a part that is some percent of a whole , then, or equivalently, .  To do the calculations, we write the percent as a decimal.    Percent Formula   Fill in the blanks:    is of ?    is  of ?    is of ?                    This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.     What is of ?   So is of .     is what of ?   So is of .     is of what?   So is of .         In most problems that involve percents, the main step is converting from the words into this formula.   Sales Tax   The sales tax in Massachusetts is 6.25%. How much tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?    Here, $140 is the whole , 6.25% is the percent , and the amount of tax paid (what we want to find) is the part . We start by writing the percent as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100). So, . We can then compute put all the pieces into the formula: So, you will need to pay $8.75 in tax for a $140 purchase.     Unit Check  Notice that we've kept the units, dollars, with the whole and that the percentage is unitless . That gives us a final answer with the units of dollars, which makes sense in the scenario of the problem. This is a fairly straightforward example; it is even more important to do this type of analysis and check in more complicated situations.    Gut Check  It is always a good idea to ask yourself if an answer makes sense. In the example above, something that might trigger an ummmm not so good , might be an answer that is far too large. If you forgot the step of converting the 6.25% into its equivalent decimal representation, your final answer would be $875.00. That's more than the pre-tax purchase! Something has gone awry and it is time to check your steps.   From Words to Formulas   Baseball batting averages are somewhat similar to percentages except that they are usually rounded to three decimal places and include the decimal point. That is, if a player got 3 hits in 10 at bats then she had a hit of the times she was at bat. Her batting average is listed as .300 in the newspapers.  a) If Fred got 12 hits in 50 times at bat, his batting average is .  b) If Mary got 139 hits in 501 times at bat, her batting average is .  If Mary got 139 hits in 501 times at bat, then she got  hits % of the times she was at bat.  Answer should be correct to 1 decimal place.  Jack's batting average is 0.27. He was at bat 148 times. That means he got hits.                       SOLUTIONS In a) just divide by 50 and round to three decimal places.  Answer is 0.24.  In b) divide by 501 and round to three decimal places.  Answer is 0.277445109780439.  In c) Your answer should be a percentage. So multiply the decimal batting average in b) by 100.  Answer is 27.7445109780439.  In d) since batting average is hits\/(at bats), hits must be batting average times at bats,  so multiply 0.27 by at bats and round the answer to be an integer.  You must round because the batting average is approximate since it is only calculated to 3 decimal places.  Ans = 40.        Percentage Increase   In the news, you hear tuition is expected to increase by 7% next year. If tuition this year was $970 per year, what will it be next year?    In this situation, the current tuition, $970, is the whole , the percent is 7%, and what we want to know (almost) is again the part . Converting 7% to the decimal 0.07 and using the same formula as above gives:   In , we were done at this point. However, this question does not ask how much is added on to the current tuition, it asks for us to compute the new tuition. So, we need to add this increase to the current amount: .  Notice again that the final answer seems reasonable (is higher than the previous year) and that the units make sense.  Alternatively, if you don't like the two step approach (or if it just makes more sense this way), you can reconsider the value we use for the percent. Since 7% is the amount increased, that is in addition to the 100% of the tuition from the previous year. So, we can still use $970 for the whole , but change the percent to 107% = 1.07, and the part will now be the next year's tuition.     Both approaches above yield the same answer, because they both correct ways of thinking about the problem. One may be more natural for your brain all the time, or you may change your preference depending on the situation. Also, it is worth mentioning that if in either or , we had a final answer with more than two digits to the right of the decimal point, we would round to the nearest cent. Similarly, while the extra zeros at the end aren't necessary, it does make it look more like a dollar amount, and it shows that you've rounded to the nearest cent.  Percentage Change   Andrew spent $16 on gasoline last week.  He will spend 25% more on gasoline this week than he did last week.  How much will Andrew spend on gasoline this week?   $41    $24    $64    $20     Solution  25% of 16 is , so he will spend $16+$4=$20.        Percentage Change   The value of a car dropped from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What percent decrease is this?    Here, the piece we're looking for is the percent . The part is the amount the quantity has changed, , and the whole is the starting amount , $7800.   The price has dropped by 8.1%.    In , the part we computed is what we call the absolute change , and the percent is called the relative change .   Absolute and Relative Change   Given two quantities, a starting and ending quantity, we can think about the change in two different ways: Absolute change is the difference between the two quantities , and relative change is the percentage that the change is compared to the starting quantity, . Absolute change has the same units as the original quantity and is always a positive number; we indicate if the quantity has increased or descreased with words. Relative change gives a percent change. The starting quantity is called the base of the percent change.    The base of a percent is very important. For example, while Nixon was president, it was argued that marijuana was a gateway drug, claiming that 80% of marijuana smokers went on to use harder drugs like cocaine. The problem is, this isn't true. The true claim is that 80% of harder drug users first smoked marijuana. The difference is one of base: 80% of marijuana smokers using hard drugs, vs. 80% of hard drug users having smoked marijuana. These numbers are not equivalent.   Absolute, Relative, and the Importance of the Base   Mount Ida College ceased all its operations and arranged for its students to transfer into various local public and private colleges. The yearly tuition (including fees) at Mount Ida was $33,500. The average tuition at the time (including fees) for Massachusetts state colleges was about $10,000. Compare the tuition costs of the Mount Ida with state colleges in Massachusetts for those students who will transfer into a public college.    There are many way to compare these two values. Different comparisons are more or less useful depending on the goal.  The easiest comparison to make is the absolute comparison: Since the tuition after the transfer is less, the result of the subtraction inside the absolute value is negative; the absolute value then makes the final answer positive. We indicate that we had a negative value with the word less in our final answer:  A student who transfers from Mount Ida to a state school will spend $23,500 less on tuition.  This is likely the most useful comparison for the student; they need to know the actual amount of money they will save or how much to adjust their loan.  However, if you wrote this in an article or paper, that number does not mean much to those less familiar with the costs. The relative difference may be more meaningful. There are two different relative changes we could calculate, depending on which college's tuition we use as the base:  Using Mount Ida's tuition as the base results in . This tells us,  The average Massachusetts state college is 70% less expensive than Mount Ida.  Using the average Massachusetts state college tuition as the base results in . This tells us,  The tuition at Mount Ida is 235% more expensive than the average state college tuition.  Notice that the quantity that comes after the phrase more than or less than is the base of the comparison. Of course, because words are hard, it won't always be this clear when folks use different phrasing, but you can usually crack the code by remembering that the base is the quantity you're comparing to ... even if that isn't clearly a starting quantity in terms of time. Both of these relative changes are percent differences .  We could also calculate the tuition cost of Mount Ida relative to state colleges in Massachusetts: which tells us,  Mount Ida was 3.35 times more expensive than an average state college in Massachusetts.  Likewise, we could calculate the tuition cost of the average state colleges in Massachusetts relative to Mount Ida: , which tells us,  State colleges' tuition cost is approximately 30% of the tuition cost of Mount Ida.    Which is larger?  The US federal debt at the end of 2006 was $8.68 trillion, and grew to $9.15 trillion by the end of 2007. At the end of 2016 it was $19.97 trillion, and grew to $20.49 trillion by the end of 2017. Which year saw a larger increase in federal debt?   From 2006 to 2007, the absolute change was , or 470 billion dollars. The relative increase for that year, , was 5.41%.  From 2016 to 2017, the absolute change was , or 520 billion dollars. The relative increase for that year, , was 2.6%.  2006-2007 saw a larger relative increase, but a smaller absolute increase.   The purpose of was to highlight the importance of the differences between absolute and relative change, in addition to carefully considering the base of a relative change. It is of course important to know which formula to use so that you can compute and produce the correct value. But it is possibly even more important to know to be a careful consumer of this type of information. The next few examples get at this a little more. Consider the situation and think for yourself first before looking at the solution. Also, remember that these solutions are quite different from final answers that are quantitative, but are rather more like interpretations of the situation. Your interpretations of what is more important or more illustrative may differ from the author's and that is fine, so long as you're making correct use of the terms and formulas.   Dropout Factories   A Seattle Times article on high school graduation rates reported The number of schools graduating 60 percent or fewer students in four years – sometimes referred to as dropout factories – decreased by 17 during that time period. The number of kids attending schools with such low graduation rates was cut in half. If the decrease by 17 number a useful comparison? Considering the last sentence, can we conclude that the number of dropout factories was originally 34?    This number is hard to evaluate since we have no basis for judging whether this is a large or small change. If the number of dropout factories dropped from 20 to 3, that would be a very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, it would be less of an improvement.  The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in perspective. We can estimate that the number of dropout factories was probably previously around 34. However, it's possible that students simply moved schools rather than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.     2004 VP Debate   In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered 90% of the coalition casualties in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies have taken almost 50 percent of the casualties. Who is correct?    Without more information, it is hard for us to judge who is correct. However, we should consider each of their words more carefully. We conclude that these two percentages are talking about different things, so one does not necessarily contradict the other. Edward's claim was a percent with casualties of coalition forces as the base of the percent, while Cheney's claim was a percent with all casualties (including Iraqi security forces) as the base of the percent. It turns out both statistics are in fact fairly accurate and we likely want more information to decide which is more important.     2012 Presidential Election   In the 2012 presidential elections, one candidate argued that the president's plan will cut $716 billion from Medicare, leading to fewer services for seniors, while the other candidate rebuts that our plan does not cut current spending and actually expands benefits for seniors, while implementing cost saving measures. Are these claims in conflict, in agreement, or not comparable because they're talking about different things?    Without more information, it is hard to judge these arguments. This is compounded by the complexity of Medicare. As it turns out, the $716 billion is not a cut in current spending, but a cut in future increases in spending, largely reducing future growth in health care payments. The rebuttal statement does not specifically mention Medicare; the cost saving measures for seniors could come in many other forms. In this case, at least the numerical claims in both statements could be considered at least partially true. Here is one source of more information if you're interested: .    The next few examples should serve as cautions for situations in which multiple percentages are given.   Stock Waves   Suppose a stock drops in value by 60% one week, then increases in value by 75% the next week. Is the value higher or lower than where it started?    Are the base of those percentages the same?    Your instinct might be to think, down by 60% and then up by 75% should be total increase of 15%, right? Unfortunately, it is not that simple, but this is one very common mistake to make when considering percents. A fancy way to say this is that in this situation, the percentages are multiplicative rather than summative.  When you're unsure, it is a great idea to try out some easy numbers and take as many steps as you need. For ease of calculations, let's pretend the starting value of the stock is $100. We can determine the price after the first week be computing a decrease of 60%:     60% of $100 is     Subtracting this gives for the price at the end of the first week.     Now, we can compute the 75% increase similarly:     75% of $40 is     Adding this gives for the price at the end of the second week.     Since $70 is lower than $100, the stock price went down over the two week time period. The absolute change is , a decrease of $30, and the relative change is , a 30% decrease.  You can come to the same conclusion algebraically by following the same steps, but using a variable, say , for the starting value rather than $100. It does not matter the starting price, it will always go down by 30% byt the end of the second week.  To see how the idea of percentages being multiplicative applies, we combine steps like we did in the second approach in . We'll do that here and use an algebraic approach. Let's use to represent the starting value of the stock. Computing a 60% drop from an initial value is equivalent to calculating 40% of the original value. We can do here because the base of all three of those percentages is , the starting value of the stock. So after the first week, the value of the stock is . Similarly, the result of a 75% increase to a value is equal to 175% of that value. So, after the second week the value of the stock is .  The absolute decrease is depends on the starting value of the stock, but the relative decrease is always .     It is not extremely important that you use the word multiplicative when discussing or thinking about percentages. However, it is good to make note of here and be sure that you understand what's happening. This will help you make stronger connections to past knowledge when we study exponential models in .   To add to the confusion... it is not the case that we can never add or subtract percentages, as we see in teh next example.   Percentage Points   A politician's support increases from 40% of voters to 50% of voters. Describe the change.    We could describe this using absolute change: . We can subtract these percetages since they have the same base , all voters, and the result has the same units, percent of all voters. To distinguish this answer from a relative change is it best to describe this as   The politician's support increased by 10 percentage points .   Alternatively, we could compute the percent change: . This is the relative change, and we'd say,   The politician's support has increased by 25%.     Another way that adding or subtracting percentages might come up is when thinking about averages.   Field Goal Percentage   A basketball player scores on 40% of their 2-point field goal attempts, and on 30% of their 3-point of field goal attempts. Find the player's overall field goal percentage.    It is very tempting to average these values, and claim the overall average is 35%, but this is likely not correct, since most players make many more 2-point attempts than 3-point attempts. We don't actually have enough information to answer the question.  Suppose the player attempted 200 2-point field goals and 100 3-point field goals. Then they made 2-point shots and 3-point shots. Thus, overall they made 110 shots out of 300, for a overall field goal percentage.  We could also think about this as a weighted average. Of the 300 total field goal attempts, 200 of them were 2-point shots. That is two thirds or 66.7% of the total shots. Of the 300 total field goal attempts, 100 of them were 3-point shots. That is one third or 33.3% of the total shots. We can use these percentages as the weights in a weighted average of the two different field goal percentages:      A Representative Government?   According to the 2020 US Census, the population of the US was 331,449,281. The racial and ethnic makeup of the population is:   57.8% White American;    18.7% Hispanic;    12.1% Black American;    5.9% Asian American;    4.1% Multiracial;    0.7% Indigenous Americans; and    0.2% Pacific Islander.   Additionally, 0.5% of Americans classified themselves as another race. The Census considers Hispanic\/Latinx as ethnicity, not race. The group here with the title Hispanic consists of people who identify as Hispanic or Latino and any race. In all other groups (except possibly the Multiracial group) respondants do not identify as Hispanic or Latino. How to best represent this group of citizens is the subject of much debate.\/ The gender divide is: 50.9% women and 49.1% men.  The US Congress has 535 members of which 100 are Senators and 435 are in the House of Representatives. The 119th Congress was not fully seated at the time of this data:           House of      Representatives  Senate    Women  125  25    Men  309  74    White American  301  83    Hispanic  46  7    Black American  61  5    Asian American  18  3    Multiracial  5  0    Indigenous American  6  0    Pacific Islander  0  0      If the Senate accurately represented the racial makeup of the US, how many senators from each of the racial groups would there be?    If the House of Representatives accurately represented the racial makeup of the US, how many representatives from each of the racial groups would there be?    If Congress had the same gender breakdown as the whole population, how many members of 2020 Congress should be women?    Choose another demographic factor. Religious affiliations, veteran status, LGBTQ identities, visible or invisible disabilities, education level, generational identity, marrital\/parental status, etc. are all interesting It is great to choose something that matters to you. Am I represented in my government? is a very important question to ask. But, know that you are not disclosing anything about yourself by what you choose here. . Is this group proportionally represented in either portion of the current Congress?  Do your best Your author wants you to know that she recognizes that this is often far more difficult than it ought to be. to find national and congressional data about that group. The Census does not collect data on everything, and even Census data is self reported and there are many reasons people may not respond accurately. Much of the reporting on these demographics could be done by special interest groups, which may sway the numbers one way or the other. Be aware.  If the group is underrespresented, try to find some hope. Is there a state or local government where this group is well represented or more visable?    "

  "body": " 2004 VP Debate   In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered 90% of the coalition casualties in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies have taken almost 50 percent of the casualties. Who is correct?    Without more information, it is hard for us to judge who is correct. However, we should consider each of their words more carefully. We conclude that these two percentages are talking about different things, so one does not necessarily contradict the other. Edward's claim was a percent with casualties of coalition forces as the base of the percent, while Cheney's claim was a percent with all casualties (including Iraqi security forces) as the base of the percent. It turns out both statistics are in fact fairly accurate and we likely want more information to decide which is more important.   "

Are these claims in conflict, in agreement, or not comparable because they're talking about different things?    Without more information, it is hard to judge these arguments. This is compounded by the complexity of Medicare. As it turns out, the $716 billion is not a cut in current spending, but a cut in future increases in spending, largely reducing future growth in health care payments. The rebuttal statement does not specifically mention Medicare; the cost saving measures for seniors could come in many other forms. In this case, at least the numerical claims in both statements could be considered at least partially true. Here is one source of more information if you're interested: .   "

  "body": " Stock Waves   Suppose a stock drops in value by 60% one week, then increases in value by 75% the next week. Is the value higher or lower than where it started?    Are the base of those percentages the same?    Your instinct might be to think, down by 60% and then up by 75% should be total increase of 15%, right? Unfortunately, it is not that simple, but this is one very common mistake to make when considering percents. A fancy way to say this is that in this situation, the percentages are multiplicative rather than summative.  When you're unsure, it is a great idea to try out some easy numbers and take as many steps as you need. For ease of calculations, let's pretend the starting value of the stock is $100. We can determine the price after the first week be computing a decrease of 60%:     60% of $100 is     Subtracting this gives for the price at the end of the first week.     Now, we can compute the 75% increase similarly:     75% of $40 is     Adding this gives for the price at the end of the second week.     Since $70 is lower than $100, the stock price went down over the two week time period. The absolute change is , a decrease of $30, and the relative change is , a 30% decrease.  You can come to the same conclusion algebraically by following the same steps, but using a variable, say , for the starting value rather than $100. It does not matter the starting price, it will always go down by 30% byt the end of the second week.  To see how the idea of percentages being multiplicative applies, we combine steps like we did in the second approach in . We'll do that here and use an algebraic approach. Let's use to represent the starting value of the stock. Computing a 60% drop from an initial value is equivalent to calculating 40% of the original value. We can do here because the base of all three of those percentages is , the starting value of the stock. So after the first week, the value of the stock is . Similarly, the result of a 75% increase to a value is equal to 175% of that value. So, after the second week the value of the stock is .  The absolute decrease is depends on the starting value of the stock, but the relative decrease is always .   "

We don't actually have enough information to answer the question.  Suppose the player attempted 200 2-point field goals and 100 3-point field goals. Then they made 2-point shots and 3-point shots. Thus, overall they made 110 shots out of 300, for a overall field goal percentage.  We could also think about this as a weighted average. Of the 300 total field goal attempts, 200 of them were 2-point shots. That is two thirds or 66.7% of the total shots. Of the 300 total field goal attempts, 100 of them were 3-point shots.

  "body": " Proportions and Rates  If you wanted to power the city of Boston using wind power, how many windmills would you need to install? Questions like these can be answered using rates and proportions.   Rate   A rate is the ratio (fraction) of two quantities. A unit rate is a rate with a denominator of one.     A Rate You Know   A car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. Express this as a rate.    Both and are rates that represent this situation. The first is more common, which we will probably recognize if we write it as an equivalent unit rate. We can divide each quantity by 15 (see ) to give the unit rate , which we could write as 20 or 20 miles per gallon.      Proportion Equation   A proportion equation is an equation showing the equivalence of two rates or ratios.    Before we dive in to using propotion equations as a tool and needing to set them up ourselves, we'll see and practice how to solve them.   Solving a Proportion Equation   Solve the proportion equation for the unknown .    One way to solve proportion equations is to multiply or divide both sides by the same quantity in an effort to get the variable alone on one side. Here, that would look like multiplying both sides by 6:   Some folks are equally or more comfortable considering the process for producing equivalent fractions, . That might look like seeing the proportion equation , and thinking,   To get from to I would have multiplied the denominator by 2, so I also need to multiply the numerator by 2 to keep the fractions equal. Five times two is ten, so .     Solve a Proportion Equation   Find an equivalent fraction to :   The question mark should be the number .        From to , we multiplied by .  For a fraction, when we multiply the same number in both the numerator and denominator, the fraction s value doesn t change. We have:        More important than solving a proportion equation (since a computer\/calculator can likely do that for you) is knowing how to set them up to answer a question or solve a problem.   Setting Up a Proportion Equation   A map scale indicates that inch on the map corresponds with 3 real miles. How many miles apart are two cities that are inches apart on the map?    We set up our proportion equation by setting equal two rates of the same form and introducing a variable, , to represent the unknown quantity the mile distance between the two cities. We can use either form for the rate, but both sides must match: Making sure the units match is an important part of the set-up, but keeping the units around for the solving just makes things messy. The cities are miles apart.    It is worth noting again that we should think of proportion equations as tools for solving problems, rather than the problems themselves. We read a problem\/situation described in words and we write down an equation to express that same information. Then, solving the equation produces the answer to the problem.  Another useful tool for solving problems that involve proportionally related quantities is called dimensional analysis . Rather than setting up an equation to solve, we determine rates that are equivalent to 1 and use the fact that any number can be multiplied by 1 without changing its value. The key here is to recognize that if two quantities look different but are in fact equal, than the ratio (fraction) of the two quantities is equal to 1. Some folks refer to these ratios as fancy ones since they are all dressed up with units. It is worth noting that the term dimensional analysis can also refer to tracking the units and dimensions through computations and formulas,    Using Dimensional Analysis   A map scale indicates that inch on the map corresponds with 3 real miles. How many miles apart are two cities that are inches apart on the map?    We need to figure out the fancy one that is useful to us here. Any fancy one can start out as an equality. For this situation, we know . This gives us two fancy ones:   We want to take the given quantity, map inches, and multiply it by one of these fancy ones to have a result in real world inches. We always want to use a fancy one that has the quantity with the units we know in the denominator, so that those units will cancel with the original. Thus, we choose the second option: The units of map inches in the numerator (remember that numbers that do not appear as fractions can be though of as being in the numerator of a fraction with a denominator of 1) cancel with the same units in the denominator of the fancy one, leaving the units of real world miles for the resulting product. Similarly to the proportion equation approach, the units themselves can help us verify that we're proceeding correctly, but can get in the way once we actually need to do some computations.   The cities are miles apart.    Visit if any of the steps in the above computation were tricky for you. The situation in and was pretty straightforward, and so both approaches look very similar. While you should always use the method that makes the most sense you your brain , the dimensional analyais approach is often more streamlined with more complicated examples.   So Many Fancy Ones   A bicycle is traveling at 15 miles per hour. How many feet will it cover in 20 seconds?    Our known quantity is 20 seconds, so that's what we start with. The speed of 15 miles per hour gives us one of the fancy ones that we'll use. The goal will be to end up with a quantity with the units of feet.    Our known quantity is 20 seconds, so the first fancy one that we're looking for will have the units of seconds in the denominator. The only other given information that represents this specific situation is the speed of the bicycle, 15 miles per hour. That will give us a fancy one that involves the units of hours, so we need to work on getting our seconds converted into hours. You are likely aware that each hour is equivalent to 60 minutes and each minute is equal to 60 seconds. Using two different fancy ones: Now, we'll use the fancy one given by the speed of the bicycle to get an equivlent distance qunatity. Finally, we need this distance in feet rather than miles. One mile is equal to 5,280 feet, which gives us our last fancy one.   It may not be obvious from the above why this approach is in anyway streamlined. We would need at least this many steps\/proportion equations to make each of these unit convertions. However, with dimensional analysis, we can just keep multiplying all the fancy ones in a single computation: We've used abbreviations for the units here to further streamline the notation. It is good practice to write out each rate (fancy one) that you multiply by, but completing more steps by hand or in your head isn't required. Sometimes a few easy mental math computations are easier than typing out more numbers into a calculator\/computer.     Streamlining a process is NOT always great for understanding. More steps that you understand is always a better solution than fewer steps that are confusing.   There are likely some unit equivalences you already know. If you don't already know the conversion, it is not worth devoting time to commit it to memory; you can look these up easily and if you use them often enough, you'll naturally memorize them without really trying. You can also use Google to do a lot of unit conversions for you, but while it will do a great job of figuring out how many ounces your 1.25 liter water bottle is, it will need more help from you if the question involves multiple different types of units (like ) or non-standard units (like ). That's where you'll need your own brain and these methods for setting up a solution, then have a machine actually do the computations.   Unit Conversions       Length      1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in)   1 meter (m) = 1000 millimeters (mm)    1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft)   1 meter (m) = 100 centimeters (cm)    1 mile (mi) = 5,280 feet (ft)   1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters (m)     1 in = 2.54 cm       Weight   Mass    1 pound (lb) = 16 ounces (oz)   1 gram (g) = 1000 milligrams (mg)    1 ton = 2000 pounds (lb)   1 kilogram (kg) = 1000 grapms(g)     2.2 lb = 1 kg       Volume      1 cup = 8 fluid ounces (fl oz)   1 liter (L) = 1000 milliliters (mL)    1 pint (pt) = 2 cups   1 cubic centimeter (cc or cm ) = 1 milliliter (mL)    1 quart (qt) = 2 pints (pt)      1 gallon (gal) = 4 quarts (qt)   1 fl oz = 29.5735 mL     This conversion between weight and mass is correct on planet Earth.  Fluid ounces are a volume measurement for liquid. One fluid ounce is equal to 1 ounce by weight if the liquid is water.       Jeff bought 6 quarts of juice for a party. One glass holds 8 fluid ounces of juice.  The total number of glasses that Jeff can fill is . [1 quart = 32 fluid ounces]        Solution  Since each quart is 32 fluid ounces, it will fill four 8 ounce glasses.  That means that 6 quarts will fill 24 glasses.       As we said in the Introduction to , it is important to use these tools only when quantities are proportional. After many examples, it may seem like all quantities are proportional.   Quantities are NOT Always Proportional   Suppose a small company spends $1000 on an advertising campaign, and gains 100 new customers from it. How many new customers should they expect if they spend $3,000?    It is tempting to say that they will gain 300 new customers; if they triple their advertising spending, then they should triple their customers. But, it is likely that additional advertising will be less effective than the initial advertising. For example, if the company is a hot tub store, there are likely only a fixed number of people interested in buying a hot tub, so there might not even be 300 people in the town who would be potential customers. The ratio of new customers to advertising spending is not always the same; it goes down with more and more spending.    "

How many new customers should they expect if they spend $3,000?    It is tempting to say that they will gain 300 new customers; if they triple their advertising spending, then they should triple their customers. But, it is likely that additional advertising will be less effective than the initial advertising. For example, if the company is a hot tub store, there are likely only a fixed number of people interested in buying a hot tub, so there might not even be 300 people in the town who would be potential customers. The ratio of new customers to advertising spending is not always the same; it goes down with more and more spending.   "

  "title": "Making Sense",
  "body": " Making Sense  Part of having excellent quantitative reasoning skills is being able to make sense of numbers. Sometimes, numbers are just difficult to comprehend. This could be because the number is huge or because the units are not something you're familiar with or just because there are lots of numbers to consider. We also want to make sure that if we're comparing or combining multiple quantities, we're doing it in a way that is reasonable and informative.   A BIG Number   Make sense of the United States total military spending of $916,014,700,000 for 2023 .    Unless you're in the very very very tiny class of very very very wealthy people, $916,014,700,000 is hard to get your head around. Naming the number can sometimes help; this is more than 916 billion dollars, nearly one trillion dollars.  Even if your quantitative reasoning skills get you a good idea of how big that number is, what is a USD really mean by itself? Most of us are the most familar with thinking about the USD to purchase everyday goods, but it is going to take a lot of boxes of cereal to reach into the hundreds of billions. So, let's think about things that cost more, but are still part of our normal lives. Unless you own a home, likely the largest number of dollars you consider is your annual salary or wages. In 2023, the average annual salary for an Assistant Professor Faculty typically start at a rank of Assistant and can move up in rank to Associate Professor or Full Professor. A promotion comes with an increased salary, so on average this is the lowest paid of those three groups. in the Massachusetts State College System was about $58,700 . Using some dimensional analysis, That means that with the DOD's budget, Massachusetts could employ more than 15 million new full time assistant professors. That's a big number still; more than twice the population of Massachusetts.  We could do a similar calculation with any other annual cost replacing the faculty salary. A smaller cost, like average public college or university tuition, would give a final number that was even larger. The DoD could cover a year of tuition for nearly 80.5 million students at public four-year schools. A larger cost, like the average salary of a player for the Boston Red Sox, would give a final number that was smaller. The DoD could pay the salaries of over 200,000 major league baseball players, or around 5,000 teams. When we're doing this type of ananlysis, we want to consider and try to balance out the sizes of all the numbers; a mix of art and science.  Even though we're being clear about our computations above, it is reasonable to say that this is an unfair method of comparison. We shouldn't really be comparing the spending of a whole nation to individuals. So, let's consider other countries' military spending as well as other US departments budgets.  The US spends much more than any other country, but it is also a large country by many measures. In 2023, the US ranked 4th The United Nations Statistics Division, the CIA World Factbook, and the Encyclopædia Britannica all rank the United States ahead of China in total area. However, the figures used by each source include coastal and territorial waters for the United States but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China. China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2,[7] less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources. Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters. in area, 3rd in population, and first in GDP (gross domestic product).  Indonesia was 4th in population . and much closer to the US and than second ranked China. We can compute military spending per capita for each country by dividing the spending by the population.   But Indonesia is a much smaller country in terms of area; about 20% of the US: . China is ranked second in military spending, and almost exaclty the same size as the US in terms of area. We can compute a ratio of military spending to area for all three countries:   What about other factors, not only people and land? After the US, China has the next highest GDP followed by Germany, and Russia has the third highest military spending, so let's look at all of these:   A country's GDP gives us some information about the strength and size of the nation's economy. But, this doesn't necessarily correlate with how much the government spends. You can see in from the International Monetary Fund that government spending as a percentage of GDP varies widely around the world and from year to year.  The chart below includes the percentage of the government's total budget that is spent on the three areas. The data is as close to 2023 as was available. The computations have been done for us, but it is still important to recognize that it is simply the formula that we've used many times. The WHOLE is each government's total budget and the PART is the amount of money the government spends on a particular area.        Country  Military  Education  Health    Brazil  2.2  13  9    China  8.8  11  5    Germany  3.1  9.2  20.5    Indonesia  4.9  14  8    Isreal  13.8  18  13    Kenya  4.3  18  8.7    Russia  14.8  8.9  13.8    Ukraine  49.1  8.5  10.6    United States  9.1  13  24.7    You can and should look at this data: , , and . You can see the data for all nations and where the US ranks overall. You can also get a better idea of how these percentages change over time and it is worth thinking about what may have caused those changes. Something else you should notice is that both education and health spending are considered part of the general goverment , which means it is not only at the federal level, but also state or local governments as well. This gives a more accurate picture of spending, but still important to note that it is different from the military calculations. Also, since the base of a percentage is very importnat, we should take note that considering the general goverment rather than just federal spending changed both the PART and the WHOLE.  This is in no way a complete analysis. The short answer to the question, Does the US government spend too much on defense? is It's complicated, but each of these approaches and comparisons shines a little more light onto what a US Department of Defense budget of $916,014,700,000 means.    We want to be able to not just make sense of quantities, but also to use them together to answer questions and evaluate situations in our lives.   Choosing a Vehicle   You're ready to buy a new car and like the Kia Sportage seems like a reasonable choice. Is it worth it to buy the hybrid or plug-in hybrid versions, or just stick to gas powered?    To make this decision, we must first decide what our basis for comparison will be. For the purposes of this example, we'll focus on fuel and purchase costs, but environmental impacts and maintenance costs are other factors a buyer might consider.  For the gas and hybrid models, we will compare the cost of gas to run both cars for a year. To determine this, we will need to know the miles per gallon both cars get, as well as the number of miles we expect to drive in a year. From that information, we can find the number of gallons required for a year. Using the price of gas per gallon, we can then find the yearly fuel cost.  According to Kia, the 2026 Sportage will get 25 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city and 33 mpg on the highway. The 2026 Sportage Hybrid makes 41 mpg in the city and 44mpg on the highway.  We'll use the estimates from our pretend person below, seperated into city miles and highway miles. That ends up being 12,480 miles of highway driving and 7,020 miles of city driving.   Currently (July 2025) the average price of gas in Massachusetts is $3.05 per gallon, according to AAA. We can use this to determine yearly fuel costs:   By choosing the hybrid option, you'd save each year on fuel costs. Note that this is an absolute difference. The fuel costs for a hybrid are lower than those for the gas powered model. Notice that the absolute difference in the numerator and the quantity we're comparing to (the words that come after than ) is in the denominator. Check back with if you need a refresher.   While both the absolute and relative comparisons are useful here, they still make it hard to answer the original question, since Is it worth it? implies there is some tradeoff for the gas savings. Indeed, the Sportage Hybrid costs about $30,290, compared to the base model for the regular Sportage, at $28,690. To better answer the Is it worth it? question, we might explore how long it will take the gas savings to make up for the additional initial cost. The hybrid costs $1600 more (another absolute difference). With gas savings of $497.45 a year, it will take about for the gas savings to make up for the higher initial costs of the hybrid option.  Considering the fuel costs for plug-in hybrid is a bit more complicated. Rather than city vs highway miles per gallon, we need to consider how much of the driving will be on the electric battery and how much on regular gasoline. The related numbers for the 2026 Sportage Plug-in Hybrid are 35 mpg on gasoline and 34 mile range while running on full electric power.  Let's say you drive to work four days a week, 30 miles each way, and can charge your car in the parking garage while at work. Since 30 miles is within but close to the range, we'll assume these drives are all electric and require a full charge of the battery. Kia reports that the hybrid battery energy is 13.8kWh and we need 4 charges off-peak at home ($0.18004 per kWh) and 4 charges at the mid-peak rate at the office ($0.29235 per kWh). The total cost of these charges is   Let's say on the one work from home day during the week and on weekends, you drive an average of 45 miles per day without a reliable charging place. You'll need gasoline for the 11 miles outside the battery's range. For three days, that's three charges (at off-peak rate) and 33 miles. At a rate of 13.8 kWh per charge and 35 mpg, that's   For a typical week, both commuting and non-commuting days, you would spend on electric and gasoline fuel.  For simplicity, we'll say these typical weeks happen 48 weeks out of the 52 in a year, and assume you don't drive at all for the other 4 weeks. But, to balance that out a little bit, we'll throw in a weekend trip every other month. These trips average 100 miles each way and 50 miles of driving around at the destination. We'll assume you don't want to stop on the drive to charge, so you'll run for 34 miles on electricity and then 66 miles on gasoline. Also, let's assume that the 50 miles of driving is spread out enough with an option to charge at the place you stay (weekends are off-peak), so it will all be electric too. That's 118 miles on electric power and 132 miles on gasoline.  We'll do this conversion to cost in a streamlined way:   All together, 48 typical weeks costing $55.25 each and 6 weekend driving trips costing $28.03 each, means to fuel your car for one year. That is less than the cost of the standard gasoline model, but more than the hybrid. THe purchase price of the plug-in hybrid is $39,890, $11,200 more than the standard gas model. The yearly fuel savings we estimated to be $141.49 that would take 80 years to make up the difference.  From a purely financial point of view, it makes sense to buy the hybrid vehicle if you'll own it for at least 3 years. If your values make a plug-in hybrid vehicle appealing, then it may be worth the extra cost. But, you may be better off financially purchasing an all electric vehicle. The Kia EV9 is the closest to the Sportage with a price of $54,900. Quick calculations using the range (230 miles), battery size (76.1 kWh), and the total miles from the above examples (19,500 miles), the cost (at off-peak) for this would be That is a yearly savings of $225.84 over the hybrid, which would take over a hundred years.  In addition to your own values and the details of your driving, there are at least three other financial things we did not include in our analysis:   The prices of gasoline and electricity are not constant, nor is their relationship, and it varies by location. Kansas's prices for both electricity and gasoline are on the lower end, while Nevada's are both high. Utah (right next door to Nevada) has high gas prices, but the electricity costs are among the lowest in the nation. Louisana's prices are reversed; expensive electricity and cheap gas.    Additionally, many state and local governments have tax credits, special rates, or incentive programs for purchasing an electric or hybrid vehicle, installing a charging stations at your home, etc. For the all electric Kia we looked at, we considered the pre-tax-credit price. That credit is $7,500, but will go away at the end of September 2025. It is likely the starting price of EVs will lower when the tax credit disappears.    Lastly, very few people buy a car all at once; it is a big purchase! Usually one pays a down payment and then has a loan to cover the rest. We will discuss how the length and interest rate of the loan affect the over all amount one pays in .     This is a case where math can help guide your decision, but it can't make it for you.      In a car dealer show room, a sales person and a customer stand looking at a car. The caption reads,   It runs on its conventional gasoline-powered engine until it senses guilt, at which point it switches over to battery power.     Both of the above examples are quite long, and we still did not consider every aspect that we could have. Similar to finding a sweet spot of the size of the quantities and units that make sense and you understand, knowing how deeply to analyze a situation is a bit of an art and the optimal amount will be different for each of us. Keep that in mind when you practice with the next situation.  Travel  If you are traveling from Boston, MA to New York, NY for a three-day trip, does it make more sense to drive, fly, or take a train?   Things you might include in your analysis:   Ticket costs (flight and train)    Gas\/Charging costs    Miles traveled    Taxi\/Uber\/Public Transit fares    Parking costs    The value of your time       Minimum Wage   In the U.S. the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour where the federal Fair Labor Standards Act applies. The minimum wage in Massachusetts is $15 per hour and is $8.75 in West Virginia. The median personal income was $48,060 in the US, $60,690 in Massachusetts, and $39.770 in West Virginia. Considering this information, answer the following questions. Pay attention to the methods you're using and try to use techniques from dimensional analysis as well as proportion equations.    In Massachusetts, how many hours on minimum wage do you need to work in a year to make the US median income? What about in West Virginia?    Referring to the answer from the previous question, find the number of hours on Massachusetts minimum wage you need to work to make the Massachusetts median income. How many hours at West Virginia's minimum wage do you need to work to make the median in come there?    The CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, made $70 billion in 2023. What is his hourly wage?    How long would someone making minimum wage (use any of the three figures you'd like) have to work to make as much as Jeff Bezos makes in an hour?    How many Massachusetts residents on minimum wage need to work simultaneously to make Jeff Bezos's hourly wage?    Using your answer from the previous question, calculate the number of West Virginian minimum wage workers needed to make Jess Bezos's hourly wage?    If Jeff Bezos were working in Massachusetts, how long would he need to work to make the median annual income?    Which of the results from your above work helps you to make sense of Jeff Bezos's immense income? Can you come up with a new comparison that works better for your brain?     Safest City   Dr. Math has worked in three different US cities during her time in the US: Tallahassee, FL; Atlanta, GA and Fitchburg, MA. Following is the table for the population and number of violent crimes reported in 2023 in each city along with the national data. Using the table below answer the following questions.       Population  Violent Crimes Reported in 2023    Fitchburg, MA  41,840  194    Atlanta, GA  513,184  3,554    Tallahassee, FL  203,665  1,753    United State  334,233,854  1,218,467      If number of violent crimes were the only criteria, which one of the three cities could be considered the safest, and which one as the most dangerous to live in? How would you decide? Try to find multiple ways to make this comparison.    Using the national data as the benchmark and\/or average, what should have been the number of violent crimes in each city for them to be considered as at the national average safety level?    Find the violent crime rate per 1000 for each city and compare it to the national rate?    "

Kansas's prices for both electricity and gasoline are on the lower end, while Nevada's are both high. Utah (right next door to Nevada) has high gas prices, but the electricity costs are among the lowest in the nation. Louisana's prices are reversed; expensive electricity and cheap gas.    Additionally, many state and local governments have tax credits, special rates, or incentive programs for purchasing an electric or hybrid vehicle, installing a charging stations at your home, etc. For the all electric Kia we looked at, we considered the pre-tax-credit price. That credit is $7,500, but will go away at the end of September 2025. It is likely the starting price of EVs will lower when the tax credit disappears.    Lastly, very few people buy a car all at once; it is a big purchase! Usually one pays a down payment and then has a loan to cover the rest. We will discuss how the length and interest rate of the loan affect the over all amount one pays in .     This is a case where math can help guide your decision, but it can't make it for you.   "

The minimum wage in Massachusetts is $15 per hour and is $8.75 in West Virginia. The median personal income was $48,060 in the US, $60,690 in Massachusetts, and $39.770 in West Virginia. Considering this information, answer the following questions. Pay attention to the methods you're using and try to use techniques from dimensional analysis as well as proportion equations.    In Massachusetts, how many hours on minimum wage do you need to work in a year to make the US median income? What about in West Virginia?    Referring to the answer from the previous question, find the number of hours on Massachusetts minimum wage you need to work to make the Massachusetts median income. How many hours at West Virginia's minimum wage do you need to work to make the median in come there?    The CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, made $70 billion in 2023. What is his hourly wage?    How long would someone making minimum wage (use any of the three figures you'd like) have to work to make as much as Jeff Bezos makes in an hour?    How many Massachusetts residents on minimum wage need to work simultaneously to make Jeff Bezos's hourly wage?    Using your answer from the previous question, calculate the number of West Virginian minimum wage workers needed to make Jess Bezos's hourly wage?    If Jeff Bezos were working in Massachusetts, how long would he need to work to make the median annual income?

  "body": " Proportional Reasoning Projects   Taxes  Governments collect taxes to pay for the services they provide. In the United States, federal income taxes help fund the military, the environmental protection agency, and thousands of other programs. Property taxes help fund schools. Gasoline taxes help pay for road improvements. While very few people enjoy paying taxes, they are necessary to pay for the services we all depend upon.  Taxes can be computed in a variety of ways, but are typically computed as a percentage of a sale, of one's income, or of one's assets. Below are some important definitions:   Effective Rate   The effective tax rate taxes effective rate is the equivalent percent rate of the tax paid out of the dollar amount the tax is based on.      Joan paid $3,200 in property taxes on her house valued at $215,000 last year. What is the effective tax rate?    We can compute the equivalent percentage; the PART is the amount paid in taxes and the WHOLE is the value of the house. The effective (property) tax rate where Joan lives is 1.49%.    Tax plans are often referred to as progressive, regressive, or flat.   Tax Categories   A flat tax taxes flat tax , or proportional tax, charges the same rate for all bases.  A progressive tax taxes progressive tax increases the tax rate as the base amount increases.  A regressive tax taxes regressive tax decreases the tax rate as the base amount increases.    The adjectives above are often used to describe the tax structure and the outcomes; and these may not match. For example, property taxes are typically a flat tax; every household in a particular jurisdiction has the same property tax rate. The property tax rate in Fitchburg is 1.338% for everyone. However, since lower income households tend to spend a higher percentage of their income on housing than higher income households, this effect is regressive; lower-income households pay a larger portion of their overall income in property taxes when compared to high-income households.  Income tax uses a progressive tax rate. If a household has a higher income, they fall into a higher bracket and pay a higher percentage of their income in federal income taxes. This seems like the outcome would also be progressive, but there are a variety of types of income that are all taxed differently. Higher-income earners tend to have more variety of types of income that typically have lower rates.  Many people have proposed various revisions to the income tax collection in the United States. Some, for example, have claimed that a flat tax would be fairer. Others call for revisions to how different types of income are taxed, since currently investment income is taxed at a different rate than wage income. The following two projects will allow you to explore some of these ideas and draw your own conclusions.    Flat Tax, Modified Flat Tax, and Progressive Tax Project    You are strongly encouraged to make use of spreadsheets for this project. Minimally, this helps you to organize the information you're calculating. If you make use of more of the functionality (see ), it can actually help clarify the process and let you focus more on which computation to do and to make sense of the outcome, rather than focussing on repeating the same computation over and over without making a mistake. You do the human things of choosing and evaluating, let a computer do the computing.  Imagine the country is made up of 100 households and that the federal government needs to collect $1,400,000 in income taxes to be able to function. The population consists of 6 groups:   Group A:  20 households that earn $17,650 each    Group B:  20 households that earn $47,590 each    Group C:  20 households that earn $80,730 each    Group D:  20 households that earn $129,400 each    Group E:  15 households that earn $221,000 each    Group F:  5 households that earn $526,200 each     This scenario is roughly proportional to the actual United States population and tax needs in 2023. We are going to determine appropriate income tax rates.     Flat Tax   The first proposal we'll consider is a flat tax one where every income group is taxed at the same percentage tax rate.    Determine the total income for the population (all 100 households together).    Determine what flat tax rate would be necessary to collect enough money.     Modified Flat Tax   The second proposal we'll consider is a modified flat-tax plan, where everyone only pays taxes on any income over $30,000. So, everyone in group A will pay no taxes. Everyone in group B will pay taxes only on $17,590.    Determine the total taxable income for the whole population.    Determine what flat tax rate would be necessary to collect enough money in this modified system.     Complete the following table for both tax plans:           Flat Tax Plan  Modified Flat Tax Plan    Group  Income per Household  Income Tax per Household  Income After Taxes  Income Tax per Household  Income After Taxes    A  $17,650        B  $47,590        C  $80,730        D  $129,400        E  $221,000        F  $526,200          Progressive Tax   The third proposal we'll consider is a progressive tax, where lower income groups are taxed at a lower percent rate, and higher income groups are taxed at a higher percent rate.  For simplicity, you may assume that a household is taxed at the same rate on all their income. In actuality, income is taxed by the bracket it falls into. For example, a household in group C would pay the Group A rate on $17,650 of their income, the B rate on the next $29,940, and the C rate on the last $33,140. If you'd like an extra challenge, feel free to follow that procedure. Just be clear that you're doing that.    Set progressive tax rates for each income group at levels that bring in enough money (the column on the right should total at least $1,400,000). There is no one right answer here just make sure you bring in enough money! You should have a different rate for each group, and a 0% tax rate is an option.          Group  Income per Household  Tax Rate  Income Tax per Household  Income After Tax  Total Tax for All Households    A  $17,650        B  $47,590        C  $80,730        D  $129,400        E  $221,000        F  $526,200        Total for All 100 Households:        Discretionary Income   Discretionary income is the income people have left over after paying for necessities like rent, food, transportation, etc. The cost of basic expenses does usually increase with income, since housing and car costs also increase with income. However, the increase in expenses is usually not proportional to the increase in income.    Explain what is meant by the increase in expenses is usually not proportional to the increase in income, in your own words.    The table below has a column for each of four different categories of essential expenses: housing, transportation, food, and medical. For each group, estimate their essential expenses in each category. Remember that most of us deal with these costs on a monthly basis, but we need annual totals in the table.  Housing should include utilities like water, electricity, heat, etc. Transportation could be a car payment, or bus tickets, or cab\/Uber rides, etc. Lower income groups may receive government assistance in any of the categories, which will change the amount they pay.  These are just estimates, but you should gather some information rather than just making things up. For consistency, consider a one-income earner family of four as your household for each group and look for your data in the same region. You may use whatever region you'd like. You may be most familiar with the state you're from, and that is worth something. Also, keep in mind that these numbers are national averages and medians, so lower than the corresponding numbers would be in a high-earner states. That means, it is even harder to live in groups A and B in a state like Massachusetts. Arizona's median income is very close the national median, which may make the whole process work out a bit easier.  Describe your process and complete the table. You do not need to carefully every category for every group. Do that for a few, and you can extrapolate\/interpolate (fancy words to mean fill in the other stuff following the trends) the rest, but remember that it should NOT be proportional . The Essential Expenses Column should be the total of the other four, and Discretionary Income (the final column) is the Income minus the Essential Expenses.

In the appropriate place in the table, enter the discretionary income for each group that you determined above.    Just as in problems #1 and #2, determine the total discretionary income for all 100 households and use this to determine an effective flat tax rate. Enter the total and rate you decide into the appropriate spaces.    As in #5, fill in the remaining two columns with how much each household pays in income tax and the total discretionary income left after paying that tax.

In the appropriate place in the table, enter the discretionary income for each group.    Determine an amount of discretionary income to not be taxed. You can use the same $30,000 as we did above, or lower amount to reflect that discretionary income is already lower than total income. Enter this amount in the appropriate place in the chart.    Just as in problems #3 and #4, determine the total taxable discretionary income for all 100 households and use this to determine an effective modified flat tax rate. Enter the total and rate you decide into the appropriate spaces.    As in #5, fill in the remaining two columns with how much each household pays in income tax and the total discretionary income left after paying that tax.              Taxable Disc.

In the appropriate place in the table enter the discretionary income for each group.    As in #6, choose a tax rate for each group and include that in the appropriate column. Compute and enter the income tax paid per household in each group and the total for all households in the group. This may take a few tries to get right; you need to make sure you're collecting at least $1,400,000.    Fill in the final column with the amount of discretionary income remaining after taxes.

Which plan seems the least fair to you? Why?  We're going to encounter a number of questions like this. There is not necessarily always a clear answer. Your job is to consider the quantitative information, your individual or community values, and make a choice. You should use the numbers as a part of your justification; this is quantitative reasoning .      Income Types and Deductions    In the previous project, we were treating all income the same; as wage income. In reality, different types of income are taxed differently and households can take deductions based on a variety of things.  Visit and locate and download the most recent version of a 1040 form. The instructions for the 1040 form can also be viewed from the same site and are helpful in determining which additional forms or schedules are needed.     Scenario 1: Calculate the taxes for someone who earned $60,000 in standard wage income (W-2 income), has no dependents, and takes the standard deduction.    Scenario 2: Calculate the taxes for someone who earned $20,000 in standard wage income, $40,000 in qualified dividends, has no dependents, and takes the standard deduction. (Qualified dividends are earnings on certain investments such as stocks.)    Scenario 3: Calculate the taxes for someone who earned $60,000 in small business income, has no dependents, and takes the standard deduction.    Based on these three scenarios, what are your impressions of how the income tax system treats these different forms of income (wage, dividends, and business income)?    Scenario 4: To get a more realistic sense for calculating taxes, you'll need to consider itemized deductions. Calculate the income taxes for someone with the income and expenses listed below.
