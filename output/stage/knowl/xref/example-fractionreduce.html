<div class="para">There are many different strategies for this process; they all differ slightly but rely on <a href="sec-fractions.html#fact-equivalentfractions" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fact-equivalentfractions.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Fact 2.1.18: Equivalent Fractions">Fact 2.1.18</a>. What we’re looking for when trying to reduce a fraction are <em class="emphasis">common factors</em> of both the numerator and denominator. A <dfn class="terminology">common factor</dfn> of a set of numbers is one that goes into every number of the set evenly with no remainders.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In this example, the numerator and denominator have several common factors. The order you notice them in will vary across people. You might notice first that 5 is a common factor. So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 5:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{90}{105} = \frac{90 \div 5}{105 \div 5} = \frac{18}{21}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Next, you might notice that 3 is a common factor of both 18 and 21. So, we divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 3:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{18}{21} = \frac{18 \div 3}{21 \div 3} = \frac{6}{7}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">All of the equal signs above are used purposely; they tell us that the value of the fraction has not changed. This is true because we used one of the “moves” allowed by <a href="sec-fractions.html#fact-equivalentfractions" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fact-equivalentfractions.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Fact 2.1.18: Equivalent Fractions">Fact 2.1.18</a>.</div>
<div class="para">There is nothing special about the order here. If we noticed that both 105 and 90 are divisible by 3 first, we could have used that first, followed by 5, and we’d end up in the same place. It is also possible that one would notice that 15 is a common factor of both 90 and 105; and so we could complete the process in a single step by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15. It is typically easier to notice smaller common factors and easier to divide by those smaller numbers, but using smaller pieces requires more steps. With practice, you’ll find a sweet spot that is good for your brain.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This can be tedious to write out this way when there are a lot of common factors. As long as you’re careful with the use of equal signs and remember the allowable moves, some people prefer a sort of cancellation notation that might look like:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{90}{105} = \frac{2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7} = \frac{2 \cdot \cancel{3} \cdot 3 \cdot \cancel{5}}{\cancel{3} \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot 7} = \frac{2 \cdot 3}{7} = \frac{6}{7}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">We know we cannot reduce this fraction further since 6 and 7 have no common factors; <span class="process-math">\(6 = 1 \cdot 6 = 2 \cdot 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(7 = 1 \cdot 7\text{.}\)</span>
