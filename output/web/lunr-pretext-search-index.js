  "body": " Fraction Arithmetic     Fraction   A fraction fraction is a number written in the form of one whole number over another, , where . The denominator , , tells us how many equally sized parts make up a whole. The numerator , , tells us how many of the parts are present.    Working with fractions can get tricky pretty quick. It is worth getting comfortable with a few real world examples that have nice fractions. This can be useful when you come across complicated and more abstract uses of fractions in the future, you can think back to something that's clear in your brain and even test out ideas with those friendly fractions, their visuals, and the situations they represent.  Pizza is helpful in many situations. Suppose a large pizza is cut into 12 equally sized pieces and that your family finished 8 of them during dinner. Since the pieces are all the same size and 12 of them make up an whole pizza, the denominator we want is 12. The number of pieces of pizza left, 4, is the numerator.   Your family ate 8 slices (unshaded) from a twelve-slice pizza, leaving 4 (shaded).      The fraction of the whole pizza left is written as and read as four twelveths . Just in case you are not a fan of pizza, there are many ways to think about and diagram this fraction:   A variety of diagrams of the fraction (shaded) and (unshaded).      We can think of the rectangle as representing desk in a classroom; the shaded desks have students sitting in them. Four twlefths of the desks have students. Perhaps the circles each represent a space in an egg carton. You've used eight twelfths of your dozen eggs. Suppose that the line segment represents a length of one foot. Since a foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shaded region is 4 inches or four twelfths of a foot. The stars could show the positions of players in a certain area of a field of play. Four twelfths of the players in this area are on the blue team and eight twelfths are on the white team.   Each whole is split into 12 equally sized parts and 4 of those parts are shaded.   Visualizing Fractions     Fill in blanks with fractions. Don t forget to reduce fractions if you can.  of the figure is shaded.  of the figure is not shaded.             The pie is cut into pieces evenly, so the denominator of the fractions is .  Since pieces are shaded, we can say of the figure is shaded. Notice that we must reduce fraction if we can.  Since pieces are not shaded, we can say of the figure is not shaded.       The fractions described above are considered proper fractions fraction proper ; the numerator is less than the denominator, . Fractions where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denomintor are called improper fractions fraction improper . Remember that fractions themselves, even though they have multiple pieces, represent a single value. A proper fraction has a value less than 1 while an improper fraction is greater than or equal to 1.   It is worth noting that outside of your math class, most people will use the word fraction in English to mean a proper fraction, and typically a proper fraction with a small value. For example, Only a fraction of the menu options are gluten free.    Since an improper fraction represents a value larger than 1, it can also be written as what is called a mixed number , a whole number and a fraction. Mixed numbers represent wholes and parts, so is 1 whole and 3 of 4 equally sized parts that make a whole. We can represent any fraction, proper or improper, in multiple ways.   Equivalent Fractions   Fractions that appear different but have the same value are called equivalent fractions fraction equivalent .    Before we get into the mechanics of equivalent fractions, let's think more about the pizza example. Even though what we'll actually be quite procedural in all our manipulations, it is important to remember what the fraction actually reprepsents.   Picturing Equivalent Fractions   Use the idea of the pizza to show that the fractions and are equivalent.    The pizza we considered earlier was cut into 12 equally sized pieces and 8 of those were eaten. If, rather than thinking about individual pieces as the equally sized parts that tell us what the denominator is, let's say that a serving of pizza is two slices. That means this pizza has 6 equally sized servings, the denominator, and if your family ate eight pieces they consumed 4 servings in total, the numerator. So, ( four sixths ) of the pizza has been eaten. We can see this visually in      We can view this as 4 out of 12 slices being shaded or as 2 out of 6 servings.      In both pizza diagrams, the same amount of pizza is shaded and the same amount remains unshaded. This is a visual to see that the fractions and are equivalent .   Try this same argument with the other diagrams in .   Most fraction computations are made simpler by using the equivalent improper fraction to a given mixed number. So, how we do convert a mixed number to an improper fraction? And, why are those equivalent? Of course, we'll start by thinking about pizza!  Suppose instead of the single large pizza from before, you order three medium pizzas each with 8 equally sized slices. This time, while you're gathering beverages, your dog takes 5 slices from one of the pizzas.   Three 8-slice pizzas with 5 slices taken.      We determine the improper fraction represented by the diagram in in the same way. Because 8 equally sized pieces make one whole pizza, this is the denominator of the fraction. The total number of slices is 19; we can see this by counting up to 19 or adding the 8 slices from each whole pizza to the three remaining slices in the partially eaten pizza. So, after the dog sneaks 5 slices, we have , nineteen eigths , of a pizza remaining. As a mixed number, this is 2 whole pizzas and 3 slices, .  Drawing diagrams to represent fractions is very useful, but not very practical for handling every fraction you come across. The procedures for converting between a mixed number, like the above, and an improper fraction are given below.   Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction     To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,  Multiply the whole number by the denominator,  Add this product to the numerator,  This sum is the new numerator of the improper fraction, and  The denominator of the improper fraction is the same as that of the fracitonal component of the mixed number.     Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction   Rewrite the mixed number as an equivalent improper fraction.         Multiply the whole number by the denominator, ,  Add this product to the numerator, ,  This sum is the new numerator of the improper fraction, and he denominator of the improper fraction is the same as that of the fracitonal component of the mixed number, .    Converting Mixed Numbers   Convert each mixed fraction to an improper fraction.  =  =  =   Multiply the whole number term by the denominator of the proper fraction. Combine with the other numerator.                       Convert an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number     To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number,  Divide the numerator by the denomintor, determine how many whole times the denominator goes in to the numerator,  Multiply this whole number quotient by the denominator,  Subtract this product from the numerator.  The quotient is the whole number, the difference is the numerator of the fractional piece, and the denominator remains the same.     Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction   Rewrite the improper fraction as an equivalent mixed number.         Divide the numerator by the denomintor, determine how many whole times the denominator goes in to the numerator, ,  Multiply this whole number quotient by the denominator, ,  Subtract this product from the numerator, .  The quotient is the whole number, the difference is the numerator of the fractional piece, and the denominator remains the same, .    Converting Improper Fractions   Change to mixed numbers.  Here is an example of how to put your answer in an answer box.  If your answer is then put 2 3\/5 into the answer  Make sure that you leave a space between the whole number and the fraction.  1) =  2) =  3) =                  Solution  1) When we divide 5 by 4 we get quotient 1 and remainder 1, so our answer is (1 1\/4).  2) When we divide 14 by 5 we get quotient 2 and remainder 4, so our answer is (2 4\/5).  3) When we divide 39 by 9 we get quotient 4 and remainder 3. But, since is not reduced,  we have to reduce it to and our answer is (4 1\/3).       We can replace any fraction or mixed number with an equivalent fraction at any step of any computation. We know the definition of quivalent fractions and can identify them in diagrams, but how to we change them numerically?   Equivalent Fractions     Any fraction, proper or improper or as a fractional piece of a mixed number, can be adjusted to an equivlent fraction by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same  non-zero number.  This tells us the allowable moves we can do to a fraction without changing its value.    We often hear the term reduced to refer to a particular form of a fraction. Usually, when someone says the fraction is reduced or in reduced form they mean that there is no other equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator or denominator. Often the reduced form a fraction is preferred, but that is not universally true.   Reduce a Fraction   Reduce the fraction as much as possible.    Since we want to make both the numerator and denominator smaller number, and keep the fraction equivalent, we look for numbers that we can divide both the numerator and denominator by.         There are many different strategies for this process; they all differ slightly but rely on . What we're looking for when trying to reduce a fraction are common factors of both the numerator and denominator. A common factor of a set of numbers is one that goes into every number of the set evenly with no remainders.  In this example, the numerator and denominator have several common factors. The order you notice them in will vary across people. You might notice first that 5 is a common factor. (Numbers that are divisible by five end with a 0 or a 5.) So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 5: .  Next, you might notice that 3 is a common factor of both 18 and 21. (If a number is divisible by three, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. For these numbers, and .) So, we divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 3: .  All of the equal signs above are used purposely; they tell us that the value of the fraction has not changed. This is true because we used one of the moves allowed by .  There is nothing special about the order here. If we noticed that both 105 and 90 are divisible by 3 first, we could have used that first, followed by 5, and we'd end up in the same place. It is also possible that one would notice that 15 is a common factor of both 90 and 105; and so we could complete the process in a single step by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15. It is typically easier to notice smaller common factors and easier to divide by those smaller numbers, but using smaller pieces requires more steps. With practice, you'll find a sweet spot that is good for your brain.  This can be tedious to write out this way when there are a lot of common factors. As long as you're careful with the use of equal signs and remember the allowable moves, some people prefer a sort of cancellation notation that might look like: .  We know we cannot reduce this fraction further since 6 and 7 have no common factors; and .  Writing and above is called the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. This simply means that we have found all the factors and nothing can be broken down into smaller pieces. Lots of folks like to use a sort of tree diagram to find this factorization. That tiny 2 that is up a little higher is an exponent. If you need a refresher, check out .    Reducing Fractions   Put in simplest form.  For example if were the answer you would put 3\/7 in the answer box.  1) =  2) =  2) =                  Solution  1) To put into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator by 2  (which is their greatest common factor) to get answer which we put in the answer box as .  2) To put into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator  by 4 to get answer which we put in the answer box as .       For some computations, we need an equivalent fraction that is not reduced. We can use the other allowable move from for this. The most common place where we'd need this is for addition or subtraction of fractions.  When fractions have the same denominator, we simply add or subtract their numerators. Remember, the denominator tells us how many equally sized parts make up a whole, and we should think of these equally sized parts as the objects. So, in our first pizza example with 12 slices, the computation could represent one person eatin 5 slices and another eating 3 slices meaning altogether they ate 8 slices. We can simply add the number of slices up for a total, because the objects we're counting up are the same.  If the denominators are not the same, maybe slices from a large pizza and slices from a medium pizza, , then a total of 8 objects doesn't tell us what we want to know. It would be equivalent to asking something like If Jack has 5 bananas and Jill has 3 apples, what do they have alltogether? They have 8 pieces of fruit altogether, but they have neither 8 apples nor 8 bananas nor 8 banapples !  In order to make sure we're counting objects that are the same, we make sure the denominators of the fractions are equal before doing any addition or subtraction. We can use both moves in on any of the fractions to make this happen.   Add Fractions   Complete the fraction addition coming from the example of pizzas with differing numbers of slices:     In order to be able to simply add the numerators, the denominators of the fractions must be the same. Try applying the moves from to one or both fractions. Can you do this so that you end up with equivalent fractions with the same denomintors?    Since both fractions and cannot be further reduced, we need to make the denominators match by making each of those numbers larger.  There are a few typical options for a common denominator , but as long as you've only used and have denomintors that are equal, any option is fine.  A common common denomintor ( words are hard ) is simply the product of the denominotrs we start with. When we multiply the 12 in the denominator by 8, we must also do the same to the numerator to keep the fraction equivalent. Similarly, multiplying the 8 denominator by 12 will make the denominators match, but we need to again do the same to the numerator to keep the fractions equivalent. In written out steps, this would look like .  Notice that this final answer is not a reduced fraction. This might not be a problem at all!   Since the denominator is very close to 100, we may be able to get better sense of how large this fraction actually is in this form: .    You might also just want to do the division in a calculator to convert this to a decimal number anyway, and in that case, the size of the numerator and denominator matter less. .    These fractions also might represent a situtation where 96 equally sized make one whole. In that case, the form of this answer tells us that we have exactly 76 of those objects.     If you do want to reduce this fraction, it works in the same way as : .  Another choice for a common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators. This approach has the benefit of keeping the denominator as small as possible, but the steps to find the least common multiple may be numerous.  For this example, the least common multiple of 12 and 8 is 24. With this common denominator, the steps look like: . This method will more often, but not always , end in an answer that is already reduced. We can see from the reduced forms, that both methods produce equvalent fractions as the final answer.    Both and present multiple methods and approaches for acheiving the same goal; the answers (while they might look different) are the same with all methods.   Carefully read different approaches so that you can apply those methods if needed. But the best method is always the one that YOUR BRAIN is the most comfortable with and makes the most sense to YOU .   Adding Fractions   Add the fractions, and reduce your answer. The reduced answer is            Conceptually, multiplication and division of fractions is trickier, but procedurally, it is easier (for most folks) than addition or subtraction. So, we'll start with the process for each operation.   Multiplying Fractions     If needed, convert all factors from mixed numbers to improper fractions, .  Multiply the numerators of all the factors to determine the numerator of the product.  Multiply the denominators of all the factors to determine the denominator of the product.  If desired, reduce the product, , or convert from an improper fraction to a mixed number, .     Multiply Fractions   Multiply .    We first convert the one mixed number factor, , into an improper fraction: .  Now, we multiply across, numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators: .  We can convert this product to a reduce mixed number: , or .    Multiplying Fractions   Simplify the following and express your answer as a single fraction. No decimals or mixed fractions.    Remember, to enter a fraction of the form , type a \/ b.   Numerators \/ Denominators            We will divert from our pizza example to help visualize and conceptualize multiplication. Pizza is still great, but things that make us think in rectangles will be better for this concept. Let's first imagine a classroom with 5 rows of 6 desks. How many desks are there total? You might do the computation and correctly give the answer of 30 desks without much thought. Thinking about rectangles and area can help us see why this answer of 30 makes sense, but also why 5 times 6 is the same as 6 times 5, and the visualization with help with fractions in just a bit.   30 desks arranged in 5 rows with 6 desks in each row.      This picture helps us visualize the five groups of six objects that the mathematical expression represents. We can also turn the picture or our heads sideways and see that the number of desks don't change. So, five groups of six objects is the same as six groups of five objects ; not an obvious truth when it is just the words.  The spaces between the squares are to help us see them as desks. We could draw a very similar picture without space to thing about the area of a rug that is 5 feet by 6 feet. Now, for a similar picture to that, but thinking in fractions this time.   An area diagram to show that .      Remember that the product of two numbers (what we get after multiplying) is the area of a rectangle with those two numbers as its length and width. The area of the entire largest square in is . (We should note that the units of the product here would be square units, like square feet if the sides were measured in feet. In the real world, this is an important distinction, but we're safe to ignore the units for this discussion of the numbers.) The area of the purple\/crosshatched rectangle we can compute via multiplication, length times width. The length measured vertically in blue is . We can tell this because that side of the square is split into 5 equally sized pieces (the denominator) and the length is 3 of those pieces (the numerator). Similary, the width measured horizontally in red is . To compute the area, we multiply these two values: . This product can be reduced, but this is a good example of when doing that reduction is not helpful. This is what the procedure for multiplication, , tells us to do, but why does this answer and process make sense?  First, the answer. We see the fraction and know this means there are 30 equally sized pices to make a whole and we are considering 15 of those pieces. We consider the largest square to be the whole, and we can count the 30 smaller rectangles that make up the whole and the 15 that are shaded purple\/crosshatched. Hooray! That answer aligns with our picture, but doesn't explain why this is always the procedure.  In order to determine how many equally sized smaller rectangles make the whole large square, we can think about it in the same way as the desks: 5 rows of 6 desks each. Notice that 5 is the denominator of the first fraction, since that side of the square is split into 5 equal segments, and 6 is the denominator of the second fraction. To determine the numerator, we need to think about the area of the purple\/crosshatched region. This is 15 rectangles as we said before, in 3 rows (the numerator fo the first fraction) of 5 rectangles (the numerator of the second fraction).   Try to draw a similar diagram for , , or a fraction multiplication problem that you make up.   Lastly, we need to know how to divide fractions. The most important thing to remember here, is that multiplication and division are inverse processes. Also, a fraction's reciprocal , exchanging the positions of the numerator and denominator, is what is called its multiplicative inverse .  So that we can all use the same language, in a division problem, like , the first number (fraction or not), , is the dividend , the second number, , is the divisor , and the answer, is the quotient . Is is also worth remembering that a fraction itself represents division, . The horizontal line in a fraction, called a vinculum tells us to to complete any operations on the top and bottom separately first, and then divide the numerator by tthe denomintor.   Dividing Fractions     If needed, convert the dividend and divisor from mixed numbers to improper fractions, .  Replace the divisor with its reciprocal and the division sign with multiplication.  Multiply the fractions.  If desired, reduce the product, , or convert from an improper fraction to a mixed number,      Divide Fractions   Divide .    We first convert the mixed number divisor, , into an improper fraction: .  Now, we flip the divisor and change the division to multiplication: .  Lastly, we mutiply across , just like :   We can reduce in the process of multiplying by canceling common factors: .    Dividing Fractions   Divide one fraction into the other:  If needed, use an improper fraction in your answer. Don’t use a mixed number.        When we do division with fractions, as with   we first change division to multiplication, and at the same time, flip the second fraction. In this case, we have   Then we do fraction multiplication as usual. The full process is:        Rather than using diagram to make sense of why fraction division works this way, we are going to try another good mathly brain habit:   Check the correctness of a procedure using nice, easy, known examples.   In this case, that means we want to use facts that we know about know about division and check if a precedure gives us the correct result. First, we should know that any non-zero number divided by itself is equal to 1. As long as I don't choose 0, I can be as whacky as I want to be with these numbers: This should give you the feeling that flipping and multiplying is at least on the right track But, how do we know which fraction to flip? You can try whole numbers that you're comfortable with: Remember that a fraction is also division, so we can write whole numbers as fractions by giving them a denominator of 1. If we had erroneously flipped the first fraction above, we would end up with an incorrect answer of .  Another option is to relate this back to words. Words can be both tricky, helpful, or both, so this approach is not going to work well for every brain. Again, sticking with nice easy number is a good plan. One can read as the question, If I split  into 2 equally sized pieces, how large are those pieces? Hopefully, we're comfortable enough thinking about what fractions are that we can see that this answer is , and that agrees with the answer we'd get following the procedure. Possibly less familiar is using the word of when we use multiplication. This makes sense with whole numbers; Five groups of six apples is apples. And, it makes sense with fractions too. \"One half of 30 apples is 15.\" Figuring out one half of something is the same as dividing that something by two. So, .  When we divide fractions with the same denominator, we're comparing the same objects, so it works similarly to addition or subtraction once we've found a common denominator. Consider . We can think of fourteenths as the objects. Since they are the same, they could be anything! Nine widgets divided by three widgets is the same as the fraction question, and we can think about dividing 9 widgets up into groups of 3 widgets each We get 3 groups! This can help us check if we should flip the first or second fraction.  For anything involving fractions, it is worth figuring out a scenario that you're comfortable with to test out ideas in. Some people who cook or bake frequently, work really well with halves and thirds and quarters, and are comfortable halving or tripling a recipe; that's division and multiplication of fractions. If you have experience in construction or carpentry, you're likely to be comfortable with halves, quarters, eigths, sixteenths, and even thirtyseconds. You are probably very comfortable knowing which drill bit is larger. Fabric for sewing is sold by the yard, and you often need to add up the different pieces to know how much total yardage you need. You can always round up to be safe, but you can also buy in quarters of a yard and not spend as much.  Fractions don't have to be scary, and the above examples are all instances where time and practice has led to being more comfortable and confident.  "

So, ( four sixths ) of the pizza has been eaten. We can see this visually in    "

Since we want to make both the numerator and denominator smaller number, and keep the fraction equivalent, we look for numbers that we can divide both the numerator and denominator by.         There are many different strategies for this process; they all differ slightly but rely on . What we're looking for when trying to reduce a fraction are common factors of both the numerator and denominator. A common factor of a set of numbers is one that goes into every number of the set evenly with no remainders.  In this example, the numerator and denominator have several common factors. The order you notice them in will vary across people. You might notice first that 5 is a common factor. (Numbers that are divisible by five end with a 0 or a 5.) So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 5: .  Next, you might notice that 3 is a common factor of both 18 and 21. (If a number is divisible by three, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. For these numbers, and .) So, we divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 3: .  All of the equal signs above are used purposely; they tell us that the value of the fraction has not changed. This is true because we used one of the moves allowed by .  There is nothing special about the order here. If we noticed that both 105 and 90 are divisible by 3 first, we could have used that first, followed by 5, and we'd end up in the same place. It is also possible that one would notice that 15 is a common factor of both 90 and 105; and so we could complete the process in a single step by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15. It is typically easier to notice smaller common factors and easier to divide by those smaller numbers, but using smaller pieces requires more steps. With practice, you'll find a sweet spot that is good for your brain.  This can be tedious to write out this way when there are a lot of common factors. As long as you're careful with the use of equal signs and remember the allowable moves, some people prefer a sort of cancellation notation that might look like: .  We know we cannot reduce this fraction further since 6 and 7 have no common factors; and .  Writing and above is called the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. This simply means that we have found all the factors and nothing can be broken down into smaller pieces. Lots of folks like to use a sort of tree diagram to find this factorization.

Try applying the moves from to one or both fractions. Can you do this so that you end up with equivalent fractions with the same denomintors?    Since both fractions and cannot be further reduced, we need to make the denominators match by making each of those numbers larger.  There are a few typical options for a common denominator , but as long as you've only used and have denomintors that are equal, any option is fine.  A common common denomintor ( words are hard ) is simply the product of the denominotrs we start with. When we multiply the 12 in the denominator by 8, we must also do the same to the numerator to keep the fraction equivalent. Similarly, multiplying the 8 denominator by 12 will make the denominators match, but we need to again do the same to the numerator to keep the fractions equivalent. In written out steps, this would look like .  Notice that this final answer is not a reduced fraction. This might not be a problem at all!   Since the denominator is very close to 100, we may be able to get better sense of how large this fraction actually is in this form: .    You might also just want to do the division in a calculator to convert this to a decimal number anyway, and in that case, the size of the numerator and denominator matter less. .    These fractions also might represent a situtation where 96 equally sized make one whole. In that case, the form of this answer tells us that we have exactly 76 of those objects.     If you do want to reduce this fraction, it works in the same way as : .  Another choice for a common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators. This approach has the benefit of keeping the denominator as small as possible, but the steps to find the least common multiple may be numerous.  For this example, the least common multiple of 12 and 8 is 24. With this common denominator, the steps look like: . This method will more often, but not always , end in an answer that is already reduced. We can see from the reduced forms, that both methods produce equvalent fractions as the final answer.   "

Consider the number 123.456. Each or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the digits of the number. The location (place) of the digit tells us what it represents (its value). The digit immediately to the left of the decimal point is the ones place so the digit and the numerical value are the same. Moving to the left increases the value of a digit by a factor of 10. So, the 2 above represents 2 tens, or 20, and the 1 represents 1 hundred, 100. Digits to the right of the decimal point represent values less than one. The first digit is in the tenths place, and tells us how many s we have. Therefore, the 4 in 123.456 represents 4 tenths, or . Moving to the right decreases the value by a factor of 10, which increases the denominator of the fraction by a factor of 10.

How can we make sense of these numbers?   Percent    Percent literally means per 100, or parts per hundred. When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction or the decimal 0.40. Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since . See .    To work with information given as percentages, it is critical to be able to write it in decimal or fraction form.    243 people out of 400 state that they like dogs. What percent is this?     . This is 60.75%.  Notice that the percent can be found from the equivalent decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the right.

Percentages     If we have a part that is some percent of a whole , then, or equivalently, .  To do the calculations, we write the percent as a decimal.    Percent Formula   Fill in the blanks:    is of ?    is  of ?    is of ?                    This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.     What is of ?   So is of .     is what of ?   So is of .     is of what?   So is of .         In most problems that involve percents, the main step is converting from the words into this formula.   Sales Tax   The sales tax in Massachusetts is 6.25%. How much tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?    Here, $140 is the whole , 6.25% is the percent , and the amount of tax paid (what we want to find) is the part . We start by writing the percent as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100). So, . We can then compute put all the pieces into the formula: So, you will need to pay $8.75 in tax for a $140 purchase.     Unit Check  Notice that we've kept the units, dollars, with the whole and that the percentage is unitless . That gives us a final answer with the units of dollars, which makes sense in the scenario of the problem. This is a fairly straightforward example; it is even more important to do this type of analysis and check in more complicated situations.    Gut Check  It is always a good idea to ask yourself if an answer makes sense. In the example above, somethign that might trigger an ummmm not so good , might be an answer that is far too large. If you forgot the step of converting the 6.25% into its equivalent decimal representation, your final answer would be $875.00. That's more than the pre-tax purchase! Something has gone awry and it is time to check your steps.   From Words to Formulas   Baseball batting averages are somewhat similar to percentages except that they are usually rounded to three decimal places and include the decimal point. That is, if a player got 3 hits in 10 at bats then she had a hit of the times she was at bat. Her batting average is listed as .300 in the newspapers.  a) If Fred got 12 hits in 50 times at bat, his batting average is .  b) If Mary got 139 hits in 501 times at bat, her batting average is .  If Mary got 139 hits in 501 times at bat, then she got  hits % of the times she was at bat.  Answer should be correct to 1 decimal place.  Jack's batting average is 0.27. He was at bat 148 times. That means he got hits.                       SOLUTIONS In a) just divide by 50 and round to three decimal places.  Answer is 0.24.  In b) divide by 501 and round to three decimal places.  Answer is 0.277445109780439.  In c) Your answer should be a percentage. So multiply the decimal batting average in b) by 100.  Answer is 27.7445109780439.  In d) since batting average is hits\/(at bats), hits must be batting average times at bats,  so multiply 0.27 by at bats and round the answer to be an integer.  You must round because the batting average is approximate since it is only calculated to 3 decimal places.  Ans = 40.        Percentage Increase   In the news, you hear tuition is expected to increase by 7% next year. If tuition this year was $970 per year, what will it be next year?    In this situation, the current tuition, $970, is the whole , the percent is 7%, and what we want to know (almost) is again the part . Converting 7% to the decimal 0.07 and using the same formula as above gives:   In , we were done at this point. However, this question does not how much is added on to the current tuition, it asks for us to compute the new tuition. So, we need to add this increase to the current amount: .  Notice again that the final answer seems reasonable (is higher than the previous year) and that the units make sense.  Alternatively, if you don't like the two step approach (or if it just makes more sense this way), you can reconsider the value we use for the percent. Since 7% is the amount increased, that is in addition to the 100% of the tuition from the previous year. So, we can still use $970 for the whole , but change the percent to 107% = 1.07, and the part will now be the next year's tuition.     Both approaches above yield the same answer, because they both correct ways of thinking about the problem. One may be more natural for your brain all the time, or you may change your preference depending on the situation. Also, it is worth mentioning that if in either or , we had a final answer with more than two digits to the reight of the decimal point, we would round to the nearest cent. Similarly, while the extra zeros at the end aren't necessary, it does make it look more like a dollar amount, and it shows that you've rounded to the nearest cent.  "

Here, $140 is the whole , 6.25% is the percent , and the amount of tax paid (what we want to find) is the part . We start by writing the percent as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100). So, .

That is, if a player got 3 hits in 10 at bats then she had a hit of the times she was at bat. Her batting average is listed as .300 in the newspapers.  a) If Fred got 12 hits in 50 times at bat, his batting average is .  b) If Mary got 139 hits in 501 times at bat, her batting average is .  If Mary got 139 hits in 501 times at bat, then she got  hits % of the times she was at bat.  Answer should be correct to 1 decimal place.  Jack's batting average is 0.27. He was at bat 148 times. That means he got hits.                       SOLUTIONS In a) just divide by 50 and round to three decimal places.  Answer is 0.24.  In b) divide by 501 and round to three decimal places.  Answer is 0.277445109780439.  In c) Your answer should be a percentage. So multiply the decimal batting average in b) by 100.  Answer is 27.7445109780439.  In d) since batting average is hits\/(at bats), hits must be batting average times at bats,  so multiply 0.27 by at bats and round the answer to be an integer.  You must round because the batting average is approximate since it is only calculated to 3 decimal places.  Ans = 40.      "

In this situation, the current tuition, $970, is the whole , the percent is 7%, and what we want to know (almost) is again the part . Converting 7% to the decimal 0.07 and using the same formula as above gives:   In , we were done at this point. However, this question does not how much is added on to the current tuition, it asks for us to compute the new tuition. So, we need to add this increase to the current amount: .  Notice again that the final answer seems reasonable (is higher than the previous year) and that the units make sense.  Alternatively, if you don't like the two step approach (or if it just makes more sense this way), you can reconsider the value we use for the percent. Since 7% is the amount increased, that is in addition to the 100% of the tuition from the previous year. So, we can still use $970 for the whole , but change the percent to 107% = 1.07, and the part will now be the next year's tuition.    "
