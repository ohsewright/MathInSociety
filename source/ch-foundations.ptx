  <title>Foundations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Math classes prior to entering college cover a bunch of concepts, procedures, skills, and applications.
      We don't all get the exrience we want in any class, and that can make it extra difficult to learn the concepts and skills and make the connections to application.
      Also, if we don't practice the procedures and skills, they get rusty if we have a great understanding to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sections in this chapter aim to strengthen that foundation your brain has already started to build.
      For you, that might mean a reminder of a procedure (like how to use logarithms to solve exponential equations) or a whole new view of concept like fractions.
      If you're finding your brain thinking something like, <q>I hated that topic!</q> or <q>I've never learned that,</q> then it would be a good idea to read through that section carefully.
      If you're working in another section and just can't remember something, you can refer back to this chapter to check.
