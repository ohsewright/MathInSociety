  <title>Proportional Reasoning</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Do you want to know what percent of your time is spent awake, working, studying, sleeping, eating etc?
      How many tiles should you purchase to finish your basement?
      Answering these questions requires knowledge of percentage, rates, and proportional reasoning.
      In this chapter, we will review these basic but powerful algebraic ideas:  percent, rates, and proportions.

    <p>
      These concepts are indeed powerful tools, but we need to make sure we apply them in appropriate situations.
      That appropriate situation is when the quantities involved are <term>proportional</term>, they always maintain the same ratio.
      An easy example to help you remember is the relationship between inches and feet.
      One foot is <alert>always</alert> equal to twelve inches.
      Another common example are ingredients in a recipe.
      Suppose your famous cookie recipe calls for 1 egg and 2 cups of sugar (among other things of course).
      If you triple the number of eggs (and use 3) then you need to also triple the amount of sugar and use 6 cups.
      The ratio (fraction) of number of eggs to cups of sugar is always the same.

      A solid understanding of fractions will serve you well in this chapter. It is worth reviewing <xref ref="sec-fractions"/> now.
