  <title>Proportional Reasoning</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Do you want to know what percent of your time is spent awake, working, studying, sleeping, eating etc? How about where your income stands compared to the rest of your co-workers, your roommate, the national average etc.? Answering these questions requires knowledge of percentage, rates, and proportional reasoning. In this chapter, we will review these basic but powerful algebraic ideas:  percent, rates, and proportions.  We will then explore how to use these ideas to solve problems where we don't have perfect information.
