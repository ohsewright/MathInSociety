                    In June 2018, Twitter was reporting 500 million tweets per day.
                    Each tweet can consist of up to 140 characters (letter, numbers, etc.).
                    Create a comparison to help understand the amount of tweets in a year by imagining each character was a drop of water and comparing to filling something up.
