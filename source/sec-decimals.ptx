  <title>Decimal Arithmetic</title>

  <p> 
    Recall that we can also view fractions as division problems and those quotients (the <q>answer</q>) in a division problem) are written as decimals.
    We convert a fraction to a decimal representation by simply doing the division.
    To convert a decimal number to its equivalent fraction representation, we need to remember place value.

    Consider the number 123.456.
    Each or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the digits of the number.
    The location (place) of the digit tells us what it represents (its value).
    The digit immediately to the left of the decimal point is the <em>ones place</em> so the digit and the numerical value are the same.
    Moving to the left increases the value of a digit by a factor of 10.
    So, the 2 above represents 2 tens, or 20, and the 1 represents 1 hundred, 100.
    Digits to the right of the decimal point represent values less than one.
    The first digit is in the <q>tenths place,</q> and tells us how many <m>frac{1}{10}</m>s we have.
    Therefore, the 4 in 123.456 represents 4 tenths, or <m>\frac{4}{10}</m>.
    Moving to the right decreases the value by a factor of 10, which increases the denominator of the fraction by a factor of 10.
    So, the 5 represents 5 onehundredths, <m>\frac{5}{100}</m>, and the 6 in the thousandths place is <m>\frac{6}{1000}</m>.
