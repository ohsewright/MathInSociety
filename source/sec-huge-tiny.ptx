    <title>Huge and Tiny Numbers</title>

    <p>
        Part of having excellent <alert>quantitative reasoning</alert> skills is being able to make sense numbers.
        Sometimes, numbers are just difficult to comprehend.
        This could be because the number is huge or because the units are not something you're familiar with.
        We also want to make sure that if we're comparing multiple quantities, we're doing it in a way that is reasonable and informative.

        <title>A BIG Number</title>
        
        <statement>
            <p>
                Make sense of the United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2025 budget of $980.88 billion.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Unless you're in the very very very tiny class of very very very wealthy people, $980.88 billion is hard to get your head around.
                Writing out all the digits of a number is a reasonable place to start.
                One billion is a single 1 with 9 zeros, so $980.88 billion is $980,880,000,000.

                Even if your quantitative reasoning skills get you a good idea of how big that number is, what is a USD really mean by itself?
                Most of us are the most familar with thinking about the USD to purchase everyday goods, but it is going to take a lot of boxes of cereal to reach into the hundreds of billions.
                So, let's think about things that cost more, but are still part of our normal lives.
                Unless you own a home, likely the largest number of dollars you consider is your annual salary or wages.
                In the Massachusetts State College System, the average annual salary for an Assistant Professor
                <fn>Faculty typically start at a rank of Assistant and can move up in rank to Associate Professor or Full Professor. A promotion comes with an increased salary, so on average this is the lowest paid of those three groups.</fn>
                is about $56,600<fn><url href="https://cthrupayroll.mass.gov/#!/year/2024/full_time_employees,others/pay1/explore/0-0-0-0-0/bargaining_group_title/Mass.+State+College+Assoc./0-barChart-0-0-0/position_title/Assistant+Professor/0-barChart-0/trans_no" /></fn>.
                Using some dimensional analysis,
                <md>
                    <mrow> $980,880,000,000 \cdot \frac{1 \text{ assistant prof}}{$56,600} \amp = 17,330,035.3</mrow>
                </md>
                That means that with the DOD's budget, Massachusetts could employ more than 17 million new full time assistant professors.
                That's a big number still; about two and half times the population of all of Massachusetts.
            </p>
            <p>
                We could do a similar calculation with any other annual cost replacing the faculty salary.
                A smaller cost, like average state 
            </p>
            <p>
                You need some familiarity with other US goverment budget numbers or the military spending of other nations in order to put this 980.88 billion dollars into context.
