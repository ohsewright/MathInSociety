    <statement>
      <p>
        <term>Percent</term> literally means <q>per 100,</q> or <q>parts per hundred.</q>
        When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction <m>\frac{40}{100}</m> or the decimal 0.40.
        Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since <m>\frac{80}{200} = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{40}{100}</m>.

  <p>
    In most problems that involve percents, the main step is converting from the words into this formula.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-salestax">
  <title>Sales Tax</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      The sales tax in Massachusetts is 6.25%.
      How much tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Here, $140 is the <em>whole</em>, 6.25% is the <em>percent</em>, and the amount of tax paid (what we want to find) is the <em>part</em>.
      We start by writing the percent as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100).
      So, <m>6.25\% = 0.0625</m>.
      We can then compute put all the pieces into the formula:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{PART} \amp = \text{PERCENT} \cdot \text{WHOLE}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{TAX} \amp = 0.0625 \cdot \$140</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \$8.75</mrow>

  <title>Unit Check</title>
    <p>
      Notice that we've kept the units, dollars, with the <em>whole</em> and that the <em>percentage</em> is <q>unitless</q>.
      That gives us a final answer with the units of dollars, which makes sense in the scenario of the problem.
      This is a fairly straightforward example; it is even more important to do this type of analysis and check in more complicated situations.

  <example xml:id="example-percentincrease">
  <title>Percentage Increase</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      In the news, you hear <q>tuition is expected to increase by 7% next year.</q>
      If tuition this year was $970 per year, what will it be next year?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      In this situation, the current tuition, $970, is the <em>whole</em>, the <em>percent</em> is 7%, and what we want to know (almost) is again the <em>part</em>.
      Converting 7% to the decimal 0.07 and using the same formula as above gives:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{PART} \amp = \text{PERCENT} \cdot \text{WHOLE}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = 0.07 \cdot $970</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = $67.90</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-salestax"/>, we were done at this point.
      However, this question does not ask how much is added on to the current tuition, it asks for us to compute the new tuition.
      So, we need to add this increase to the current amount:
      <me>
        \text{New Tuituion} = $970.00 + $67.90 = $1037.90
      </me>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice again that the final answer seems reasonable (is higher than the previous year) and that the units make sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if you don't like the two step approach (or if it just makes more sense this way), you can reconsider the value we use for the percent.
      Since 7% is the amount increased, that is in addition to the 100% of the tuition from the previous year.
      So, we can still use $970 for the <em>whole</em>, but change the <em>percent</em> to 107% = 1.07, and the <em>part</em> will now be the next year's tuition.
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{PART} \amp = \text{PERCENT} \cdot \text{WHOLE}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = 1.07 \cdot $970</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = $1037.90</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Both approaches above yield the same answer, because they both correct ways of thinking about the problem.
    One may be more natural for your brain all the time, or you may change your preference depending on the situation.
    Also, it is worth mentioning that if in either <xref ref="example-salestax"/> or <xref ref="example-percentincrease"/>, we had a final answer with more than two digits to the right of the decimal point, we would round to the nearest cent.
    Similarly, while the extra zeros at the end aren't necessary, it does make it look more like a dollar amount, and it shows that you've rounded to the nearest cent.

  <definition xml:id="def-absoluterelativechange">
    <title>Absolute and Relative Change</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given two quantities, a starting and ending quantity, we can think about the change in two different ways:
        <term>Absolute change</term> is the difference between the two quantities
        <me> \text{absolute change} = \left| \text{ending quantity} - \text{starting quantity} \right|</me>, and
        <term>relative change</term> is the percentage that the change is compared to the starting quantity, 
        <me> \text{relative change} = \frac{\text{absolute change}}{\text{starting quantity}}</me>.
        Absolute change has the same units as the original quantity and is always a positive number; we indicate if the quantity has increased or descreased with words.
        Relative change gives a percent change.
        The starting quantity is called the <term>base</term> of the percent change.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The base of a percent is very important.
    For example, while Nixon was president, it was argued that marijuana was a <q>gateway</q> drug, claiming that 80% of marijuana smokers went on to use harder drugs like cocaine.
    The problem is, this isn't true.
    The true claim is that 80% of harder drug users first smoked marijuana.
    The difference is one of base: 80% of marijuana smokers using hard drugs, vs. 80% of hard drug users having smoked marijuana.
    These numbers are not equivalent.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-mountida">
    <title>Absolute, Relative, and the Importance of the Base</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Mount Ida College ceased all its operations and arranged for its students to transfer into various local public and private colleges.
        The yearly tuition (including fees) at Mount Ida was $33,500.
        The average tuition at the time (including fees) for Massachusetts state colleges was about $10,000.
        Compare the tuition costs of the Mount Ida with state colleges in Massachusetts for those students who will transfer into a public college.    
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are many way to compare these two values.
        Different comparisons are more or less useful depending on the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest comparison to make is the absolute comparison:
        <me>
          |\$10000 - \$33500| = |-\$23500| = \$23500
        </me>
        Since the tuition after the transfer is less, the result of the subtraction inside the absolute value is negative; the absolute value then makes the final answer positive.
        We indicate that we had a negative value with the word <q>less</q> in our final answer: 
      </p>
      
      <blockquote><p>A student who transfers from Mount Ida to a state school will spend $23,500 <alert>less</alert> on tuition.</p></blockquote>
      
      <p>  
        This is likely the most useful comparison for the student; they need to know the actual amount of money they will save or how much to adjust their loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you wrote this in an article or paper, that number does not mean much to those less familiar with the costs.
        The relative difference may be more meaningful.
        There are two different relative changes we could calculate, depending on which college's tuition we use as the base:
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Mount Ida's tuition as the base results in <m>\frac{\$23500}{\$33500} = 0.7</m>.
        This tells us,
      </p>
      
      <blockquote><p>The average Massachusetts state college is 70% less expensive than Mount Ida.</p></blockquote>
    
      <p>
        Using the average Massachusetts state college tuition as the base results in <m>\frac{\$23500}{\$10000} = 2.35</m>.
        This tells us,
      </p>
      
      <blockquote><p>The tuition at Mount Ida is 235% more expensive than the average state college tuition.</p></blockquote> 
      
      <p>
        Notice that the quantity that comes after the phrase <q>more than</q> or <q>less than</q> is the base of the comparison.
        Of course, because words are hard, it won't always be this clear when folks use different phrasing, but you can usually crack the code by remembering that the base is the quantity you're <alert>comparing to</alert>... even if that isn't clearly a <q>starting quantity</q> in terms of time.
        Both of these relative changes are <alert>percent differences</alert>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could also calculate the tuition cost of Mount Ida relative to state colleges in Massachusetts: <m>\frac{\$33500}{\$10000} = 3.35</m> which tells us,
      </p>
      
      <blockquote><p>Mount Ida was 3.35 times more expensive than an average state college in Massachusetts.</p></blockquote>
      
      <p>
        Likewise, we could calculate the tuition cost of the average state colleges in Massachusetts relative to Mount Ida: <m>\frac{\$10000}{\$33500} \approx .3 = 30\%</m>, which tells us,
      </p>
      
      <blockquote><p>State colleges' tuition cost is approximately 30% of the tuition cost of Mount Ida.</p></blockquote>

  <p>
    The purpose of <xref ref="check-absolutevsrelative"/> was to highlight the importance of the differences between absolute and relative change, in addition to carefully considering the base of a relative change.
    It is of course important to know which formula to use so that you can compute and produce the correct value.
    But it is possibly even more important to know to be a careful consumer of this type of information.
    The next few examples get at this a little more.
    Consider the situation and think for yourself first before looking at the solution.
    Also, remember that these <q>solutions</q> are quite different from final answers that are quantitative, but are rather more like interpretations of the situation.
    Your interpretations of what is more important or more illustrative may differ from the author's and that is fine, so long as you're making correct use of the terms and formulas.

    <title>Dropout Factories</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        A Seattle Times article on high school graduation rates reported <q>The number of schools graduating 60 percent or fewer students in four years – sometimes referred to as <sq>dropout factories</sq> – decreased by 17 during that time period.
        The number of kids attending schools with such low graduation rates was cut in half.</q>  
        If the <q>decrease by 17</q> number a useful comparison?
        Considering the last sentence, can we conclude that the number of dropout factories was originally 34?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This number is hard to evaluate since we have no basis for judging whether this is a large or small change.
        If the number of dropout factories dropped from 20 to 3, that would be a very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, it would be less of an improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in perspective.
        We can estimate that the number of dropout factories was probably previously around 34.
        However, it's possible that students simply moved schools rather than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.

      <p>
        Without more information, it is hard to judge these arguments.
        This is compounded by the complexity of Medicare.
        As it turns out, the $716 billion is not a cut in current spending, but a cut in future increases in spending, largely reducing future growth in health care payments.
        The rebuttal statement does not specifically mention Medicare; the cost saving measures for seniors could come in many other forms.
        In this case, at least the numerical claims in both statements could be considered at least partially true.

    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Your instinct might be to think, down by 60% and then up by 75% should be total increase of 15%, right?
        Unfortunately, it is not that simple, but this is one <alert>very common</alert> mistake to make when considering percents.
        A fancy way to say this is that in this situation, the percentages are multiplicative rather than summative.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're unsure, it is a great idea to try out some easy numbers and take as many steps as you need.
        For ease of calculations, let's pretend the starting value of the stock is $100.
        We can determine the price after the first week be computing a decrease of 60%:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              60% of $100 is <m>0.6 \cdot $100 = $60</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Subtracting this gives <m>$100 - $60 = $40</m> for the price at the end of the first week.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>  
      Now, we can compute the 75% increase similarly:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              75% of $40 is <m>0.75 \cdot $40 = $30</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Adding this gives <m>$40 + $30 = $70</m> for the price at the end of the second week.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since $70 is lower than $100, the stock price went down over the two week time period.
        The absolute change is <m>|$70 - $100| = |-$30| = 30$</m>, a decrease of $30,
        and the relative change is <m>\frac{30}{100} = 0.3</m>, a 30% decrease.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can come to the same conclusion algebraically by following the same steps,
        but using a variable, say <m>x</m>, for the starting value rather than $100.
        It does not matter the starting price, it will always go down by 30% byt the end of the second week.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see how the idea of percentages being <q>multiplicative</q> applies, we combine steps like we did in the second approach in <xref ref="example-percentincrease"/>.
        We'll do that here and use an algebraic approach.
        Let's use <m>x</m> to represent the starting value of the stock.
        Computing a 60% drop from an initial value is equivalent to calculating 40% of the original value.
        We can do <m>100% - 60% = 40%</m> here because the base of all three of those percentages is <m>x</m>, the starting value of the stock.
        So after the first week, the value of the stock is <m>0.4 \cdot x = 0.4x</m>.
        Similarly, the result of a 75% increase to a value is equal to 175% of that value.
        So, after the second week the value of the stock is <m>1.75 \cdot 0.4x = 0.7x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The absolute decrease is <m>|0.7x - x| = |-0.3x| = 0.3x</m> depends on the starting value of the stock,
        but the relative decrease is always <m>\frac{0.3x}{x} = 0.3 = 30\%</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <observation xml:id="obs-multiplicative-exponential">
    <p>
      It is not extremely important that you use the word <q>multiplicative</q> when discussing or thinking about percentages.
      However, it is good to make note of here and be sure that you understand what's happening.
      This will help you make stronger connections to past knowledge when we study exponential models in <xref ref="sec-exponential"/>.
    </p>
  </observation>

  <p>
    To add to the confusion... it is not the case that we can never add or subtract percentages, as we see in the next example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-politicalsupport">
    <title>Percentage Points</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        A politician's support increases from 40% of voters to 50% of voters.
        Describe the change.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We could describe this using absolute change: <m>|50\% - 40\%| = 10\%</m>.
        We can subtract these percetages since they have <alert>the same base</alert>, all voters,
        and the result has the same units, percent of all voters.
        To distinguish this answer from a relative change is it best to describe this as
      </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
           The politician's support increased by 10 <alert>percentage points</alert>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      <p>
        Alternatively, we could compute the percent change: <m>\frac{10\%}{40\%} = 0.25 = 25\%</m>.
        This is the relative change, and we'd say, 
      </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The politician's support has increased by 25%.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Another way that adding or subtracting percentages might come up is when thinking about averages.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-fieldgoalpercentage">
    <title>Field Goal Percentage</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        A basketball player scores on 40% of their 2-point field goal attempts, 
        and on 30% of their 3-point of field goal attempts.
        Find the player's overall field goal percentage.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        It is very tempting to average these values, and claim the overall average is 35%,
        but this is likely not correct, since most players make many more 2-point attempts than 3-point attempts.
        We don't actually have enough information to answer the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose the player attempted 200 2-point field goals and 100 3-point field goals.
        Then they made <m>0.4 \cdot 200 = 80</m> 2-point shots and <m>0.3 \cdot 100 = 30</m> 3-point shots.  
        Thus, overall they made 110 shots out of 300, for a <m>\frac{110}{300} \approx 0.3667 = 36.67\%</m> overall field goal percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could also think about this as a <q>weighted average.</q>
        Of the 300 total field goal attempts, 200 of them were 2-point shots.
        That is two thirds or 66.7% of the total shots.
        Of the 300 total field goal attempts, 100 of them were 3-point shots.
        That is one third or 33.3% of the total shots.
        We can use these percentages as the <term>weights</term> in a weighted average of the two different field goal percentages:
        <md>
          <mrow> (0.667 \cdot 40\%) + (0.333 \cdot 30\%) \amp = 26.68\% + 9.99\% = 36.67\%.</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
