    In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered <q>90% of the coalition casualties</q> in Iraq.
    Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies <q>have taken almost 50 percent</q> of the casualties.<fn><url href="http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html">http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html</url></fn>
    Who is correct?  How can we make sense of these numbers?

    <title>Percent</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <term>Percent</term> literally means <q>per 100,</q> or <q>parts per hundred.</q>
        When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction <m>\frac{40}{100}</m> or the decimal 0.40.
        Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since <m>\frac{80}{200} = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{40}{100}</m>.
        See <xref ref="fact-equivalentfractions"/>.

  <p>
    To work with information given as percentages, it is critical to be able to write it in decimal or fraction form. 
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-percent">
    <statement>
      <p>
        243 people out of 400 state that they like dogs. What percent is this?
      </p>
    </statement>  
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>\frac{243}{400} = 0.6075 = \frac{60.75}{100}</m>. This is 60.75%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that the percent can be found from the equivalent decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the right.
      </p>
    </solution>

    <title>Percent Formula</title>
    <webwork source="Library/PCC/BasicAlgebra/NumberBasics/PercentOfNumber70.pg" />
  </exercise>

  <p>
    In most problems that involve percents, the main step is converting from the words into this formula.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-salestax">
  <title>Sales Tax</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      The sales tax in Massachusetts is 6.25%.
      How much tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Here, $140 is the <em>whole</em>, 6.25% is the <em>percent</em>, and the amount of tax paid (what we want to find) is the <em>part</em>.
      We start by writing the percent as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100).
      So, <m>6.25\% = 0.0625</m>.
      We can then compute put all the pieces into the formula:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{PART} \amp = \text{PERCENT} \cdot \text{WHOLE}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{TAX} \amp = 0.0625 \cdot \$140</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \$8.75</mrow>
      </md>
      So, you will need to pay $8.75 in tax for a $140 purchase.
    </p>
  </solution>
  </example>

  <insight xml:id="insight-units">
  <title>Unit Check</title>
    <p>
      Notice that we've kept the units, dollars, with the <em>whole</em> and that the <em>percentage</em> is <q>unitless</q>.
      That gives us a final answer with the units of dollars, which makes sense in the scenario of the problem.
      This is a fairly straightforward example; it is even more important to do this type of analysis and check in more complicated situations.
    </p>
  </insight>

  <insight xml:id="insight-gut">
  <title>Gut Check</title>
    <p>
      It is always a good idea to ask yourself if an answer makes sense.
      In the example above, somethign that might trigger an <q>ummmm not so good</q>, might be an answer that is far too large.
      If you forgot the step of converting the 6.25% into its equivalent decimal representation, your final answer would be $875.00.
      That's more than the pre-tax purchase! Something has gone awry and it is time to check your steps.

  <exercise xml:id="check-percentwordproblem">
  <title>From Words to Formulas</title>
  <webwork source="Library/NewHampshire/unh_schoolib/Percent/pctsrs201.pg" />
  </exercise>

  <example xml:id="example-percentincrease">
  <title>Percentage Increase</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      In the news, you hear <q>tuition is expected to increase by 7% next year.</q>
      If tuition this year was $970 per year, what will it be next year?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      In this situation, the current tuition, $970, is the <em>whole</em>, the <em>percent</em> is 7%, and what we want to know (almost) is again the <em>part</em>.
      Converting 7% to the decimal 0.07 and using the same formula as above gives:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{PART} \amp \text{PERCENT} \cdot \text{WHOLE}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp 0.07 \cdot $970</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp $67.90</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-salestax"/>, we were done at this point.
      However, this question does not how much is added on to the current tuition, it asks for us to compute the new tuition.
      So, we need to add this increase to the current amount:
      <me>
        \text{New Tuituion} = $970.00 + $67.90 = $1037.90
      </me>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice again that the final answer seems reasonable (is higher than the previous year) and that the units make sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if you don't like the two step approach (or if it just makes more sense this way), you can reconsider the value we use for the percent.
      Since 7% is the amount increased, that is in addition to the 100% of the tuition from the previous year.
      So, we can still use $970 for the <em>whole</em>, but change the <em>percent</em> to 107% = 1.07, and the <em>part</em> will now be the next year's tuition.
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{PART} \amp \text{PERCENT} \cdot \text{WHOLE}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp 1.07 \cdot $970</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp $1037.90</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Both approaches above yield the same answer, because they both correct ways of thinking about the problem.
    One may be more natural for your brain all the time, or you may change your preference depending on the situation.
    Also, it is worth mentioning that if in either <xref ref="example-salestax"/> or <xref ref="example-percentincrease"/>, we had a final answer with more than two digits to the reight of the decimal point, we would round to the nearest cent.
    Similarly, while the extra zeros at the end aren't necessary, it does make it look more like a dollar amount, and it shows that you've rounded to the nearest cent.
