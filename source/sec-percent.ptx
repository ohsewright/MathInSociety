    In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered <q>90% of the coalition casualties</q> in Iraq.
    Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies <q>have taken almost 50 percent</q> of the casualties.<fn><url href="http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html">http://www.factcheck.org/cheney_edwards_mangle_facts.html</url></fn>
    Who is correct?  How can we make sense of these numbers?

    <statement>
      <p>
        <term>Percent</term> literally means <q>per 100,</q> or <q>parts per hundred.</q>
        When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction <m>\frac{40}{100}</m> or the decimal 0.40.
        Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since <m>\frac{80}{200} = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{40}{100}</m>.

  <p>
    To work with information given as percentages, it is critical to be able to write it in decimal or fraction form. 
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-percent">
    <statement>
      <p>
        243 people out of 400 state that they like dogs. What percent is this?
      </p>
    </statement>  
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>\frac{243}{400} = 0.6075 = \frac{60.75}{100}</m>. This is 60.75%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that the percent can be found form the equivalent decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the right.
      </p>
