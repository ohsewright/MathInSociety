    <title>Taxes</title>

    <p>
        Governments collect taxes to pay for the services they provide.
        In the United States, federal income taxes help fund the military, the environmental protection agency, and thousands of other programs.
        Property taxes help fund schools.
        Gasoline taxes help pay for road improvements.
        While very few people enjoy paying taxes, they are necessary to pay for the services we all depend upon.
    </p>

    <p>
        Taxes can be computed in a variety of ways, but are typically computed as a percentage of a sale, of one's income, or of one's assets.
        Below are some important definitions:
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-effective-rate">
    <title>Effective Rate</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The <term>effective tax rate</term><idx><h>taxes</h><h>effective rate</h></idx> is the equivalent percent rate of the tax paid out of the dollar amount the tax is based on.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="example-taxrate">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Joan paid $3,200 in property taxes on her house valued at $215,000 last year.
                What is the effective tax rate?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We can compute the equivalent percentage; the PART is the amount paid in taxes and the WHOLE is the value of the house.
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{\$3,200}{\$215,000} \approx 0.0149 = 1.49\%</mrow>
                </md>
                The effective (property) tax rate where Joan lives is 1.49%.
            </p>
        </solution>

        Tax plans are often referred to as progressive, regressive, or flat.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-taxplans">
    <title>Tax Categories</title>
        <statement>
            <p>

        The adjectives above are often used to describe the tax structure and the outcomes; and these may not match.
        For example, property taxes are typically a flat tax; every household in a particular jurisdiction has the same property tax rate.
        The property tax rate in Fitchburg is 1.338% for everyone.
        However, since lower income households tend to spend a higher percentage of their income on housing than higher income households,
        this effect is regressive; lower-income households pay a larger portion of their overall income in property taxes when compared to high-income households.
    </p>
    <p>
        Income tax uses a progressive tax rate.
        If a household has a higher income, they fall into a higher bracket and pay a higher percentage of their income in federal income taxes.
        This seems like the outcome would also be progressive, but there are a variety of types of income that are all taxed differently.
        Higher-income earners tend to have more variety of types of income that typically have lower rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many people have proposed various revisions to the income tax collection in the United States.
        Some, for example, have claimed that a flat tax would be fairer.
        Others call for revisions to how different types of income are taxed, since currently investment income is taxed at a different rate than wage income.
        The following two projects will allow you to explore some of these ideas and draw your own conclusions.

        You are strongly encouraged to make use of spreadsheets for this project.
        Minimally, this helps you to organize the information you're calculating.
        If you make use of more of the functionality (see <xref ref="sec-spreadsheets"/>), it can actually help clarify the process and let you focus more on which computation to do and to make sense of the outcome,
        rather than focussing on repeating the same computation over and over without making a mistake.
        You do the human things of choosing and evaluating, let a computer do the computing.

        Imagine the country is made up of 100 households and that the federal government needs to collect $1,400,000 in income taxes to be able to function.
        The population consists of 6 groups:
        <dl>
            <li>
                <title>Group A:</title>

            <li>
                <title>Group B:</title>
                <p>
                    20 households that earn $47,590 each

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Group D:</title>
                <p>
                    20 households that earn $129,400 each
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Group E:</title>
                <p>
                    15 households that earn $221,000 each
                </p>

                <p>
                    5 households that earn $526,200 each
                </p>
            </li>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>    
        This scenario is roughly proportional to the actual United States population and tax needs in 2023.
        We are going to determine appropriate income tax rates.

        <title>Progressive Tax</title>
        
        
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    The third proposal we'll consider is a progressive tax, where lower income groups are taxed at a lower percent rate, and higher income groups are taxed at a higher percent rate.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    For simplicity, you may assume that a household is taxed at the same rate on all their income.
                    In actuality, income is taxed by the bracket it falls into.
                    For example, a household in group C would pay the Group A rate on $17,650 of their income, the B rate on the next $29,940, and the C rate on the last $33,140.
                    If you'd like an extra challenge, feel free to follow that procedure. Just be clear that you're doing that.

                        There is no one right answer here <mdash/> just make sure you bring in enough money!
                        You should have a different rate for each group, and a 0% tax rate is an option.

        <title>Discretionary Income</title>
        
        
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Discretionary income is the income people have left over after paying for necessities like rent, food, transportation, etc.
                    The cost of basic expenses does usually increase with income, since housing and car costs also increase with income.
                    However, the increase in expenses is usually not proportional to the increase in income. 
                </p>
            </introduction>
        
            <exercise>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Explain what is meant by <q>the increase in expenses is usually not proportional to the increase in income,</q> in your own words.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </exercise>

            <exercise>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        The table below has a column for each of four different categories of essential expenses: housing, transportation, food, and medical.
                        For each group, estimate their essential expenses in each category.
                        Remember that most of us deal with these costs on a monthly basis, but we need annual totals in the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Housing should include utilities like water, electricity, heat, etc.
                        Transportation could be a car payment, or bus tickets, or cab/Uber rides, etc. 
                        Lower income groups may receive government assistance in any of the categories, which will change the ammount they pay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are just estimates, but you should gather some information rather than just making things up.
                        For consistency, consider a one-income earner family of four as your household for each group and look for your data in the same region.
                        You may use whatever region you'd like. You may be most familiar with the state you're from, and that is worth something.
                        Also, keep in mind that these numbers are national averages and medians, so lower than the corresponding numbers would be in a high-earner states.
                        That means, it is even harder to live in groups A and B in a state like Massachusetts.
                        Arizona's median income is very close the national median, which may make the whole process <q>work out</q> a bit easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Describe your process and complete the table.
                        You do not need to carefully every category for every group.
                        Do that for a few, and you can extrapolate/interpolate (fancy words to mean fill in the other stuff following the trends) the rest,
                        <alert>but remember that it should NOT be proportional</alert>.
                        The Essential Expenses Column should be the total of the other four, and Discretionary Income (the final column) is the Income minus the Essential Expenses.

                        Complete the table to reflect a Modified Flat Tax Plan based on discretionary income.
                        <ol>

                                    Determine an amount of discretionary income to not be taxed.
                                    You can use the same $30,000 as we did above, or lower amount to reflect that discretionary income is already lower than total income.
                                    Enter this amount in the appropriate place in the chart.

                                    Just as in problems #3 and #4, determine the total taxable discretionary income for all 100 households and use this to determine an effective modified flat tax rate.
                                    Enter the total and rate you decide into the appropriate spaces.
                                </p>

                                    As in #6, choose a tax rate for each group and include that in the appropriate column.
                                    Compute and enter the income tax paid per household in each group and the total for all households in the group.
                                    This may take a few tries to get right; you need to make sure you're collecting at least $1,400,000.
