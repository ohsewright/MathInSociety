  <title>Proportions and Rates</title>

    If you wanted to power the city of Boston using wind power, how many windmills would you need to install?
    Questions like these can be answered using rates and proportions.

    <title>Rate</title>
    
    
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <term>rate</term> is the ratio (fraction) of two quantities.
            A <term>unit rate</term> is a rate with a denominator of one.
        </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="example-rate">
    <title>A Rate You Know</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            A car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. Express this as a rate.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            Both <m>\frac{300 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ gallons}}</m> and <m>\frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{300 \text{ miles}}</m> are rates that represent this situation.
            The first is more common, which we will probably recognize if we write it as an equivalent unit rate.
            We can divide each quantity by 15 (see <xref ref="fact-equivalentfractions"/>) to give the unit rate <m>\frac{20 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ gallon}}</m>, 
            which we could write as <q>20 <m>\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}</m></q> or <q>20 miles per gallon.</q>
        </p>
    </solution>

    <title>Proportion Equation</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <term>proportion equation</term> is an equation showing the equivalence of two rates or ratios.

    Before we dive in to using propotion equations as a tool and needing to set them up ourselves, we'll see and practice how to solve them.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-propeqsolve">
    <title>Solving a Proportion Equation</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Solve the proportion equation <m>\frac{5}{3} = \frac{x}{6}</m> for the unknown <m>x</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            One way to solve proportion equations is to multiply or divide both sides by the same quantity in an effort to get the variable alone on one side.
            Here, that would look like multiplying both sides by 6:
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{5}{3} \amp = \frac{x}{6}</mrow>
                <mrow>6 \cdot \frac{5}{3} \amp = \frac{x}{6} \cdot 6</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{6 \cdot 5}{3} \amp = x</mrow>
                <mrow>10 \amp = x</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some folks are equally or more comfortable considering the process for producing equivalent fractions, <xref ref="fact-equivalentfractions"/>.
            That might look like seeing the proportion equation <m>\frac{5}{3} = \frac{x}{6}</m>, and thinking,
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                To get from <m>\frac{5}{3}</m> to <m>\frac{x}{6}</m> I would have multiplied the denominator by 2,
                so I also need to multiply the numerator by 2 to keep the fractions equal.
                Five times two is ten, so <m>x=10</m>.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        
    </solution>
